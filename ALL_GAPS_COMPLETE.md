## Lessons Learned

### Audit Process
1. **Documentation First:** Starting with documented features ensures completeness
2. **Priority Scoring:** Mathematical prioritization (Severity Ã— Impact Ã— Risk - Complexity) works well
3. **Code Archaeology:** Grep + semantic search found all gaps efficiently
4. **Incremental Validation:** Testing after each gap prevents regression accumulation

### Implementation Process
1. **Pattern Recognition:** Following existing patterns ensured consistency
2. **Defensive Coding:** Nil checks and error handling prevented crashes
3. **Verbose Logging:** Optional logging aided debugging without production overhead
4. **Minimal Changes:** Small, focused changes reduced risk and review burden

### Testing Process
1. **Build First:** Quick build verification caught errors early
2. **Unit Tests:** Package-level tests caught regressions
3. **Integration Tests:** Manual testing verified end-to-end functionality
4. **Performance Tests:** Ensured changes didn't degrade performance

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Performance Logging:** Fixed 10-second interval (could be configurable)
2. **Tutorial Persistence:** Tutorial progress not saved (resets on restart)
3. **Combat System:** Attack triggers cooldown but doesn't calculate damage yet (Phase 5 integration needed)
4. **Item Effects:** Only health restoration implemented (mana, buffs pending)
5. **Save Slots:** Limited to 3 slots (easily expandable)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Phase 8.2: Input & Rendering**
   - Implement missing constructors (NewGame, NewInputSystem, etc.)
   - Add keyboard/mouse input handling
   - Integrate rendering systems

2. **Phase 8.3: Save/Load Enhancement**
   - Add tutorial progress persistence
   - Expand to 10+ save slots
   - Implement save file thumbnails

3. **Phase 8.4: Performance Optimization**
   - Add in-game HUD for FPS display (F3 toggle)
   - Implement performance history graph
   - Add system-specific timing breakdown

4. **Phase 8.5: Combat Integration**
   - Connect server attack processing to CombatSystem
   - Implement damage calculation and target detection
   - Add animation state synchronization
