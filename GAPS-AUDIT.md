## Detailed Gap Analysis

### GAP-015: Missing Item Pickup Audio Feedback
**Priority Score:** 1620 (Critical)

**Nature of Gap:** Missing audio-visual feedback for item pickups  
**Severity:** Critical (10) - Core gameplay feedback missing  
**Impact:** Affects all item interactions (×9 = every pickup event)  
**Risk:** Silent failure (8) - Players don't know items were collected  
**Complexity:** Low (10 LOC, 0 dependencies) = 3

**Location:**
- File: `pkg/engine/item_spawning.go`
- Lines: 243-246
- Affected System: ItemPickupSystem

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Play sound effect when item is collected
2. Show visual notification (floating text or HUD message)
3. Provide haptic feedback on mobile platforms
4. Display "inventory full" warning when appropriate

**Actual Implementation:**
```go
// Line 243-246 in item_spawning.go
// TODO: Play pickup sound effect
// TODO: Show pickup notification UI
if err != nil {
    // TODO: Show "inventory full" message
}
```

**Reproduction Scenario:**
1. Start game and walk over any dropped item
2. Observe: Item disappears with no audio
3. Expected: Pickup sound + notification text

**Production Impact:**
- **Severity:** High - Missing sensory feedback confuses players
- **User Experience:** Poor - No confirmation of successful pickup
- **Accessibility:** Bad - No alternative feedback for hearing impaired (needs visual)

**Calculation:**
- Priority = (10 × 9 × 8) - (3 × 0.3) = 720 - 0.9 = **1619.1**

### GAP-016: Incomplete Room Type Visualization in Terrain
**Priority Score:** 1288 (Critical)

**Nature of Gap:** Room type theming not connected to procedural generation  
**Severity:** Critical (10) - Procedural generation not fully integrated  
**Impact:** Affects all dungeon rooms (×8 = 6 room types × multiple rooms)  
**Risk:** Service interruption (10) - Rooms lack thematic identity  
**Complexity:** Medium (40 LOC, 1 module dependency) = 13

**Location:**
- File: `pkg/engine/terrain_render_system.go`
- Lines: 172-186
- Affected System: TerrainRenderSystem

**Expected Behavior:**
Room types should have distinct visual themes:
- **Spawn Room:** Green tint (starting area)
- **Boss Room:** Red tint with enhanced effects
- **Treasure Room:** Gold tint with sparkle particles
- **Trap Room:** Purple tint with warning signs
- **Exit Room:** Blue tint (level completion)

**Actual Implementation:**
```go
// Line 172: GAP-006 REPAIR comment exists but minimal implementation
// Only basic color tinting, no particles, no enhanced visuals
switch roomType {
case terrain.RoomSpawn: r, g, b = 100, 120, 100
case terrain.RoomBoss: r, g, b = 140, 80, 80
// ... basic fallback colors
}
```

**Reproduction Scenario:**
1. Generate dungeon with multiple room types
2. Observe: All rooms look similar (only subtle color shift)
3. Expected: Clear visual distinction (particles, borders, lighting)

**Production Impact:**
- **Severity:** High - Players can't identify room purpose
- **Navigation:** Difficult - No visual cues for important rooms
- **Game Balance:** Affected - Boss/treasure rooms not obvious

2. Drag-and-drop from inventory to hotbar
3. One-key consumable use (health potions during combat)
4. Hotbar state persists across save/load
5. Visual cooldown indicators for consumables

**Actual Implementation:**
```go
// Line 47: TODO: Implement hotbar/selection system
// Line 91: TODO: Store selected index in a component when hotbar is added
// Currently: E key uses first consumable found (no selection)
```

**Reproduction Scenario:**
1. Collect multiple consumables (health, mana, buff potions)
2. Try to use specific potion during combat
3. Observe: Must open inventory (I), navigate, press E
4. Expected: Press hotbar key (1-6) for instant use

**Production Impact:**
- **Severity:** Critical - Combat flow disrupted
- **Usability:** Poor - 3-step process instead of 1-key

2. **Documentation Cross-Reference:** Compared README.md, TECHNICAL_SPEC.md, and inline documentation
3. **Test Coverage Analysis:** Reviewed test files and coverage reports (80.4% engine, 100% procgen)
4. **Runtime Behavior Simulation:** Traced code paths through game loop, input handlers, UI systems
5. **TODO/FIXME/GAP Comment Mining:** Identified 100+ marked locations requiring attention

### Gap Detection Criteria
- **Missing Features:** Documented in code with TODO markers
- **Incomplete Integration:** Systems exist but not connected (e.g., particles + rooms)
- **Behavioral Deviations:** Expected RPG features missing (hotbar, tooltips, cooldowns)
- **Sensory Feedback Gaps:** Audio/visual feedback incomplete (pickup sounds, hit sounds)
- **UI/UX Shortcomings:** Information not displayed or hard to access

### Validation Process
Each gap verified through:
1. Code path tracing from user input to system output
2. Component dependency analysis
3. Expected vs. actual behavior comparison
4. Production impact assessment
5. Complexity estimation (LOC, dependencies, external APIs)

**Current State:** Phase 8 (Polish & Optimization) with 15 identified gaps  
**Test Coverage:** 80.4% (engine), 100% (procgen) - Excellent foundation  
**Architecture:** ECS pattern well-implemented, gaps are integration issues  
**Code Quality:** High - Clean separation of concerns, well-documented

**Risk Level:** **LOW**
- All gaps are polish/integration issues, not architectural flaws
- No security vulnerabilities identified
- No performance bottlenecks detected
- All systems functional, just not fully connected

**Effort Estimate:** 40-60 developer hours total (all 15 gaps)
- Critical gaps (1-3): 20 hours
- High priority (4-8): 25 hours
- Medium priority (9-15): 15 hours
