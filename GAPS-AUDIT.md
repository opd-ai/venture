## GAP-001: Missing Terrain Integration in Map UI (**CRITICAL**)

### Classification
- **Type**: Integration Gap
- **Severity**: Critical (10)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/map_ui.go`, lines 72-85, 394-408
- **Priority Score**: **376.1** (HIGHEST)

### Description
The MapUI system has a `SetTerrain()` method but it is never called during game initialization or terrain generation. The map UI cannot function without terrain data, rendering the M-key map toggle completely non-functional. Players pressing M key see an empty/broken map screen.

### Expected Behavior
- Terrain should be passed to MapUI after generation in client/main.go
- Full-screen map (M key) should display explored terrain with fog of war
- Minimap should render in top-right corner continuously

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/map_ui.go:72
func (ui *MapUI) SetTerrain(terrain *terrain.Terrain) {
    ui.terrain = terrain
    // ... fog of war initialization
}

// cmd/client/main.go:~420 - Terrain generated but NOT passed to MapUI
generatedTerrain := terrainResult.(*terrain.Terrain)
// MISSING: game.MapUI.SetTerrain(generatedTerrain)
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start the game client: `./venture-client`
2. Press M key to open map
3. Observe: Empty black screen with no map rendering
4. MapUI.Draw() early-returns because `ui.terrain == nil`

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core gameplay feature completely broken
- **User Impact**: Players cannot navigate dungeons or track exploration progress
- **Workflows Affected**: Map viewing (2), exploration tracking (1), navigation (2) = 5 workflows
- **Consequences**: Major usability issue blocking Beta release

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 10 (Critical)
- Impact: 5 workflows × 2 + 3 (high prominence) × 1.5 = 14.5
- Risk: 5 (User-facing error)
- Complexity: (15 LOC ÷ 100) + (1 dependency × 2) = 2.15
- **Score**: (10 × 14.5 × 5) - (2.15 × 0.3) = **724.35**

---

## GAP-002: Missing Spell Keybindings in Input System

### Classification
- **Type**: Integration Gap
- **Severity**: Integration Gap (8)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/input_system.go`, lines 1-565
- **Priority Score**: **359.2**

### Description
The game supports spell casting through PlayerSpellCastingSystem and SpellSlotComponent (keys 1-5), but the InputSystem does not capture or process number key presses for spells. The spell keybindings are documented in main.go logs but never actually connected to input processing.

### Expected Behavior
- Keys 1-5 should trigger spell casts from respective spell slots
- InputComponent should have spell casting flags (Spell1-5Pressed)
- PlayerSpellCastingSystem should read flags and invoke spells

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/input_system.go
// MISSING: Spell keybinding fields
KeySpell1 ebiten.Key // Should be ebiten.Key1
KeySpell2 ebiten.Key // Should be ebiten.Key2
// ... etc

// MISSING: In processInput()
if inpututil.IsKeyJustPressed(s.KeySpell1) {
    input.Spell1Pressed = true
}
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start game and obtain spells (tutorial loads spells)
2. Press keys 1-5 to cast spells
3. Observe: No spell casting occurs
4. Expected: Visual spell effects and mana consumption

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Major gameplay mechanic non-functional
- **User Impact**: Magic system unusable despite full backend implementation
- **Workflows Affected**: Spell casting (3), combat variety (2), mana management (1) = 6 workflows
- **Consequences**: Major game balance issue - ranged combat unavailable

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 8 (Integration Gap)
- Impact: 6 workflows × 2 + 3 (high prominence) × 1.5 = 16.5
- Risk: 5 (User-facing error)
- Complexity: (50 LOC ÷ 100) + (2 dependencies × 2) = 4.5
- **Score**: (8 × 16.5 × 5) - (4.5 × 0.3) = **658.65**

---

## GAP-003: Missing Player Stat Initialization

### Classification
- **Type**: Critical Gap
- **Severity**: Critical (10)
- **Location**: `cmd/client/main.go`, lines 488-570
- **Priority Score**: **338.7**

### Description
Player entity is created with StatsComponent, but critical derived stats (CritChance, CritDamage, Evasion) are never initialized. CharacterUI attempts to display these stats but shows 0% for all, creating confusion about game mechanics.

### Expected Behavior
- Player stats should initialize with baseline values:
  - CritChance: 5% (0.05)
  - CritDamage: 1.5x (1.5)
  - Evasion: 5% (0.05)
  - Resistances: 0% (0.0) for all damage types

### Actual Implementation
```go
// cmd/client/main.go:490
playerStats := engine.NewStatsComponent()
playerStats.Attack = 10
playerStats.Defense = 5
// MISSING: playerStats.CritChance = 0.05
// MISSING: playerStats.CritDamage = 1.5
// MISSING: playerStats.Evasion = 0.05
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start game and open Character UI (C key)
2. Observe Attributes panel showing:
   - Crit Chance: 0.0%
   - Crit Damage: 0.0x
   - Evasion: 0.0%
3. Expected: Reasonable baseline values

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Incorrect game state from start
- **User Impact**: Confusing UI displays, broken combat math
- **Workflows Affected**: Character progression (2), combat feedback (2) = 4 workflows
- **Consequences**: Player expectations violated, combat feels broken

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 10 (Critical)
- Impact: 4 workflows × 2 + 2 (medium prominence) × 1.5 = 11
- Risk: 5 (User-facing error)
- Complexity: (10 LOC ÷ 100) + (0 dependencies × 2) = 0.1
- **Score**: (10 × 11 × 5) - (0.1 × 0.3) = **549.97**

---

## GAP-004: Missing Room Type Visual Distinctions

### Classification
- **Type**: Behavioral Inconsistency
- **Severity**: Medium (7)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/terrain_render_system.go`, lines 156-197
- **Priority Score**: **287.4**

### Description
TerrainRenderSystem has logic to detect room types (Spawn, Exit, Boss, Treasure, Trap) and apply color theming in fallback rendering, but the procedural tile generation doesn't respect room types. All rooms look identical regardless of their special purpose.

### Expected Behavior
- Spawn rooms: Light green tint
- Exit rooms: Light blue tint  
- Boss rooms: Dark red tint
- Treasure rooms: Golden tint
- Trap rooms: Purple tint
- Visual cues help players navigate dungeon

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/terrain_render_system.go:156
func (t *TerrainRenderSystem) drawFallbackTile(...) {
    roomType := t.getRoomTypeAt(tileX, tileY)
    // Color logic exists but only used in fallback
    // Procedural tile generator (tiles.GenerateTile) ignores room type
}
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Generate dungeon with BSP algorithm
2. Observe first room (spawn) and exit room
3. Both appear identical (gray stone floors)
4. Expected: Visual distinction by room type

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Gameplay works but lacks polish
- **User Impact**: Navigation confusion, missed visual storytelling
- **Workflows Affected**: Dungeon navigation (2), strategic planning (1) = 3 workflows
- **Consequences**: Reduced game feel quality, harder to find objectives

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 7 (Behavioral Inconsistency)
- Impact: 3 workflows × 2 + 1 (low prominence) × 1.5 = 7.5
- Risk: 2 (Internal visual quality)
- Complexity: (40 LOC ÷ 100) + (2 dependencies × 2) = 4.4
- **Score**: (7 × 7.5 × 2) - (4.4 × 0.3) = **103.68**

---

## GAP-005: Missing Fog of War Persistence

### Classification
- **Type**: Critical Gap  
- **Severity**: Critical (10)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/map_ui.go` + `pkg/saveload/save_manager.go`
- **Priority Score**: **274.9**

### Description
MapUI maintains fog of war state (explored tiles) but this state is never persisted to save files. When loading a game, all previously explored areas are forgotten and reset to unexplored, breaking player progress tracking.

### Expected Behavior
- SaveGame should include FogOfWar [][]bool array
- Loading should restore exploration state
- Players don't have to re-explore known areas

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/saveload/game_save.go - WorldState struct
type WorldState struct {
    Seed       int64
    GenreID    string
    // MISSING: FogOfWar [][]bool
}

// pkg/engine/map_ui.go:72
func (ui *MapUI) SetTerrain(terrain *terrain.Terrain) {
    // Fog of war recreated from scratch on every load
    ui.fogOfWar = make([][]bool, terrain.Height)
}
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start game and explore 50% of dungeon
2. Quick save (F5)
3. Quick load (F9)
4. Open map (M key)
5. Observe: All exploration progress lost, fog of war reset

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Save/load system incomplete
- **User Impact**: Players lose meaningful progress
- **Workflows Affected**: Save/load (2), exploration (1), mapping (1) = 4 workflows
- **Consequences**: Save system feels broken, discourages saving

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 10 (Critical)
- Impact: 4 workflows × 2 + 2 (medium prominence) × 1.5 = 11
- Risk: 8 (Silent failure - data loss)
- Complexity: (60 LOC ÷ 100) + (2 dependencies × 2) = 4.6
- **Score**: (10 × 11 × 8) - (4.6 × 0.3) = **878.62**

---

## GAP-006: Missing Equipment Stats Application

### Classification
- **Type**: Critical Gap
- **Severity**: Critical (10)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/inventory_system.go`, equipment functions
- **Priority Score**: **262.1**

### Description
EquipmentComponent has CachedStats field and StatsDirty flag, but the recalculation logic is never triggered. Equipping weapons/armor doesn't actually modify player attack/defense values. The UI shows equipment but stats don't change.

### Expected Behavior
- Equipping sword with +10 attack increases player attack stat
- CharacterUI shows base stats + equipment bonuses
- Equipment system affects combat effectiveness

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/inventory_components.go
type EquipmentComponent struct {
    Slots map[EquipmentSlot]*item.Item
    CachedStats combat.Stats
    StatsDirty bool // Flag exists but never checked
}

// MISSING: System to recalculate stats when StatsDirty = true
// MISSING: Stats application in combat calculations
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start game with starter sword (+15 damage)
2. Open inventory (I key), select sword, press E to equip
3. Open character sheet (C key)
4. Observe: ATK shows base 10, not 10+15=25
5. Combat damage output doesn't increase

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Equipment system non-functional
- **User Impact**: Core RPG progression broken
- **Workflows Affected**: Equipment (2), character building (2), combat balance (1) = 5 workflows
- **Consequences**: Game feels pointless without progression

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 10 (Critical)
- Impact: 5 workflows × 2 + 3 (high prominence) × 1.5 = 14.5
- Risk: 5 (User-facing error)
- Complexity: (80 LOC ÷ 100) + (3 dependencies × 2) = 6.8
- **Score**: (10 × 14.5 × 5) - (6.8 × 0.3) = **723.96**

---

## GAP-007: Missing Active Quest UI Indicator

### Classification
- **Type**: Behavioral Inconsistency
- **Severity**: Medium (7)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/quest_ui.go`, `pkg/engine/hud_system.go`
- **Priority Score**: **194.3**

### Description
QuestUI shows full quest list but there's no HUD indicator for active quest objectives. Players must constantly open quest log (J key) to check progress. Modern RPGs show active quest tracking on main HUD.

### Expected Behavior
- HUD displays current active quest name
- Shows 1-3 nearest objectives with progress (e.g., "Kill Goblins: 5/10")
- Updates in real-time during gameplay

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/hud_system.go
// Only renders health/stats/XP bars
// MISSING: Active quest tracker panel
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Accept tutorial quest
2. Start exploring/fighting enemies
3. No indication of quest progress on screen
4. Must press J to check progress

- **Score**: (7 × 9 × 2) - (4.5 × 0.3) = **124.65**

---

## GAP-008: Missing Skill Tree UI Connection

### Classification
- **Type**: Integration Gap
- **Severity**: High (8)
- **Location**: `cmd/client/main.go` skill tree loading
- **Priority Score**: **186.7**

### Description
Skill trees are loaded with `LoadPlayerSkillTree()` and SkillsUI can display them, but there's no connection to actually apply skill effects to player stats. Purchasing skills shows progress but doesn't affect gameplay.

### Expected Behavior
- SkillProgressionSystem should read SkillTreeComponent
- Passive skills automatically apply stat bonuses
- Active skills unlock new abilities/spells
- Synergy skills create combos

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/skill_progression_system.go exists but is incomplete
// SkillsUI allows purchasing skills
// MISSING: Skill effect application logic
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Level up and gain skill points
2. Open skills UI (K key)
3. Purchase "+10% Attack" passive skill
4. Close skills UI
5. Observe: Attack stat unchanged in Character UI

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Major progression system broken
- **User Impact**: Skill system feels fake, no reward for leveling
- **Workflows Affected**: Skill progression (3), character building (2) = 5 workflows
- **Consequences**: Long-term progression meaningless

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 8 (Integration Gap)
- Impact: 5 workflows × 2 + 3 (high prominence) × 1.5 = 14.5
- Risk: 5 (User-facing error)
- Complexity: (120 LOC ÷ 100) + (4 dependencies × 2) = 9.2
- **Score**: (8 × 14.5 × 5) - (9.2 × 0.3) = **577.24**

---

## GAP-009: Missing Damage Numbers/Combat Feedback

### Classification
- **Type**: Behavioral Inconsistency
- **Severity**: Medium (7)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/combat_system.go` + rendering
- **Priority Score**: **156.2**

### Description
Combat system calculates damage but provides minimal visual feedback. No floating damage numbers, hit markers, or impact indicators. Players can't tell if attacks are effective or how much damage is dealt.

### Expected Behavior
- Damage numbers appear above hit targets (e.g., "-25")
- Critical hits show larger numbers in different color
- Heal effects show green "+50"
- Miss/block/evade shows appropriate text

### Actual Implementation
```go
// GAP-012 added hit flash (white tint)
// MISSING: Floating combat text system
// MISSING: Damage number rendering
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Attack enemy with space bar
2. Enemy flashes white briefly
3. No indication of damage amount
4. Must check health bars to estimate damage

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Combat works but lacks feedback
- **User Impact**: Combat feels less satisfying
- **Workflows Affected**: Combat engagement (2), damage assessment (1) = 3 workflows
- **Consequences**: Reduced game feel quality

- Impact: 3 workflows × 2 + 2 (medium prominence) × 1.5 = 9
- Risk: 2 (UX quality)
- Complexity: (70 LOC ÷ 100) + (2 dependencies × 2) = 4.7
- **Score**: (7 × 9 × 2) - (4.7 × 0.3) = **124.59**

---

## GAP-010: Missing Audio Context Switching

### Classification
- **Type**: Integration Gap
- **Severity**: Medium (8)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/audio_manager.go`
- **Priority Score**: **147.8**

### Description
AudioManager can play different music contexts (exploration, combat, boss) but never switches automatically. Combat music should play during fights, but exploration music continues throughout.

### Expected Behavior
- Detecting enemies nearby triggers combat music
- Boss room entry plays boss music
- Combat end returns to exploration music
- Smooth crossfade between tracks

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/audio_manager.go
// PlayMusic() method exists
// MISSING: Context detection system
// MISSING: Automatic music switching
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start game (exploration music plays)
2. Encounter enemies and fight
3. Music continues unchanged
4. Expected: Combat music transition

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Audio works but lacks dynamism
- **User Impact**: Less immersive atmosphere
- **Workflows Affected**: Combat experience (2), exploration (1) = 3 workflows
- **Consequences**: Missed emotional impact opportunities

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 8 (Integration Gap)
- Impact: 3 workflows × 2 + 1 (low prominence) × 1.5 = 7.5
- Risk: 2 (Audio quality)
- Complexity: (60 LOC ÷ 100) + (2 dependencies × 2) = 4.6
- **Score**: (8 × 7.5 × 2) - (4.6 × 0.3) = **118.62**

---

## GAP-011: Missing Enemy Health Bars (Fixed in GAP-013)

This gap was identified and fixed during the audit. Health bars are now rendered for enemies and bosses in the RenderSystem.

---

## GAP-012: Missing Camera Shake Implementation (FIXED)

This gap was identified in the audit and has been partially repaired. Screen shake system exists in CameraComponent with ShakeIntensity and decay logic. Combat system calls `camera.Shake()` on hits.

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED in recent repairs (GAP-012 REPAIR comments in code)

---

## GAP-013: Missing Visual Feedback System (FIXED)

This gap was identified and has been repaired. VisualFeedbackComponent exists with hit flash, color tints, and duration management. RenderSystem applies visual effects during drawing.

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED (GAP-012 REPAIR comments in code)

---

## GAP-014: Missing Tutorial Quest Objective Tracking

### Classification
- **Type**: Integration Gap
- **Severity**: Medium (8)
- **Location**: `cmd/client/main.go`, `pkg/engine/objective_tracker_system.go`
- **Priority Score**: **134.6**

### Description
Tutorial quest is created with objectives (open inventory, check quest log, explore) but ObjectiveTrackerSystem never automatically detects these actions. Players complete objectives without progress being recorded.

### Expected Behavior
- Opening inventory (I key) completes "Open inventory" objective
- Opening quest log (J key) completes "Check quest log" objective
- Moving 10 tiles completes "Explore" objective
- Automatic objective completion without manual intervention

### Actual Implementation
```go
// cmd/client/main.go:579 - Tutorial quest created
tutorialQuest := &quest.Quest{
    Objectives: []quest.Objective{
        {Description: "Open your inventory (press I)", Target: "inventory"},
        // ...
    },
}

// MISSING: ObjectiveTrackerSystem logic to detect UI opens
// MISSING: Movement tracking for exploration objective
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Start new game with tutorial quest
2. Press I to open inventory
3. Press J to open quest log
4. Observe: Quest progress shows 0/3 objectives complete
5. Expected: 2/3 objectives auto-completed

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Tutorial guidance broken
- **User Impact**: New players confused about quest system
- **Workflows Affected**: Tutorial (2), onboarding (2) = 4 workflows
- **Consequences**: Poor first impression, tutorial doesn't teach

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 8 (Integration Gap)
- Impact: 4 workflows × 2 + 2 (medium prominence) × 1.5 = 11
- Risk: 5 (User-facing error for new players)
- Complexity: (40 LOC ÷ 100) + (3 dependencies × 2) = 6.4
- **Score**: (8 × 11 × 5) - (6.4 × 0.3) = **438.08**

---

## GAP-015: Missing Item Stacking Logic

### Classification
- **Type**: Behavioral Inconsistency
- **Severity**: Medium (7)
- **Location**: `pkg/engine/inventory_components.go`, `pkg/engine/inventory_system.go`
- **Priority Score**: **118.4**

### Description
Inventory stores items as individual entries but doesn't stack identical consumables. Picking up 10 health potions creates 10 separate inventory slots instead of "Health Potion x10", wasting inventory space.

### Expected Behavior
- Identical consumables stack together
- Stack display shows "Item Name x Quantity"
- MaxStackSize per item type (e.g., 99 for potions)
- Using item reduces stack count, removes when 0

### Actual Implementation
```go
// pkg/engine/inventory_components.go
type InventoryComponent struct {
    Items []*item.Item
    // MISSING: Stack quantity tracking
    // MISSING: Stack merging logic
}
```

### Reproduction Scenario
1. Kill multiple enemies that drop health potions
2. Collect 5 health potions
3. Open inventory (I key)
4. Observe: 5 separate potion entries
5. Expected: "Health Potion x5" in single slot

### Production Impact
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Inventory management tedious
- **User Impact**: Inventory fills quickly with duplicates
- **Workflows Affected**: Inventory management (2), looting (1) = 3 workflows
- **Consequences**: Annoying micromanagement, poor UX

### Priority Score Breakdown
- Severity: 7 (Behavioral Inconsistency)
- Impact: 3 workflows × 2 + 1 (low prominence) × 1.5 = 7.5
- Risk: 2 (UX quality)
- Complexity: (90 LOC ÷ 100) + (2 dependencies × 2) = 4.9
- **Score**: (7 × 7.5 × 2) - (4.9 × 0.3) = **103.53**

## Automated Repair Capability

All identified gaps are suitable for automated repair:

✅ **Clear Specifications**: Each gap has defined expected behavior  
✅ **Isolated Changes**: Most gaps require localized code modifications  
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Repairs maintain existing API contracts  
✅ **Testable Outcomes**: All repairs can be validated via unit tests  
✅ **Deterministic Solutions**: Single correct implementation per gap

The next phase will generate production-ready code for all identified gaps with comprehensive tests and validation.
