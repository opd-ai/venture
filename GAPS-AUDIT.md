## Priority-Ranked Gaps

### Gap #1: Client Missing Network Connection Flags [Priority Score: 168.0]
**Severity:** Critical
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "Start the client (single-player or connecting to server)" (README.md:656)

**Implementation Location:** `cmd/client/main.go:19-23`

**Expected Behavior:** Client should accept command-line flags to connect to a remote server, including server address/host and port. README states client can be used in "single-player or connecting to server" mode.

**Actual Implementation:** Client only has flags for local settings (width, height, seed, genre, verbose). No network connection flags exist. Client cannot connect to the multiplayer server mentioned throughout Phase 6 documentation.

**Gap Details:** The README describes a client that can operate in two modes: single-player and multiplayer (connecting to server). However, the client binary has no flags for specifying server connection parameters. The client code creates local game systems but has zero network client initialization code. The network package has a complete Client implementation (`pkg/network/client.go`), but it's never instantiated in `cmd/client/main.go`.

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
# Expected to work (from README line 656):
./venture-client -server localhost:8080

# Actual result:
flag provided but not defined: -server
```

**Production Impact:** Critical - Multiplayer functionality is completely inaccessible. The server can run, but no client can connect to it. This makes Phase 6 (Networking & Multiplayer) non-functional from a user perspective despite the networking code being implemented.

**Code Evidence:**
```go
// cmd/client/main.go:19-23
var (
	width   = flag.Int("width", 800, "Screen width")
	height  = flag.Int("height", 600, "Screen height")
	seed    = flag.Int64("seed", 12345, "World generation seed")
	genreID = flag.String("genre", "fantasy", "Genre ID (fantasy, scifi, horror, cyberpunk, postapoc)")
	verbose = flag.Bool("verbose", false, "Enable verbose logging")
)
// No server, host, or network flags defined
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 10 (Critical - feature completely missing) × User Impact: 6.0 (multiplayer is major feature + prominently documented) × Production Risk: 8 (silent failure - app runs but can't do advertised multiplayer) - Complexity: 20 (requires client-server integration + UI for connection status + error handling)
- Final Score: 168.0

### Gap #2: Menu System Not Integrated Into Client [Priority Score: 147.0]
**Severity:** Critical
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "In-game (when implemented in Phase 8.5): F5 - Quick save, F9 - Quick load, Menu - Save/Load interface" (README.md:626-630)

**Implementation Location:** `cmd/client/main.go:166-555`, `pkg/engine/menu_system.go:1-502`, `pkg/engine/game.go:1-173`

**Expected Behavior:** Client should have a menu system accessible via ESC or similar key, providing save/load interface. README states "Menu - Save/Load interface" will be available.

**Actual Implementation:** MenuSystem is fully implemented in `pkg/engine/menu_system.go` with 502 lines of code including save/load functionality, UI rendering, and menu navigation. However, it is NEVER instantiated or integrated into the client. The Game struct in `pkg/engine/game.go` has no MenuSystem field. Client only registers F5/F9 callbacks directly, bypassing the menu UI entirely.

**Gap Details:** A comprehensive menu system exists with:
- Main menu with save/load options
- Save file browsing with metadata
- Confirmation dialogs
- Error message display
- Full keyboard navigation

Yet this system is completely orphaned. The client never creates a MenuSystem instance, Game.Draw() never renders it, and no key binding opens it. Users get quick save/load via F5/F9 but no visual feedback, file management, or confirmation dialogs that the MenuSystem provides.

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```go
// Expected: Press ESC to open menu
// Actual: ESC only opens help system (pkg/engine/help_system.go)
// MenuSystem never instantiated in cmd/client/main.go
```

**Production Impact:** Critical - Users have no visual save/load interface. They must remember F5/F9 keys with no feedback. Cannot browse save files, see save metadata (date, level, location), or confirm overwrite operations. Poor user experience for a core feature.

**Code Evidence:**
```go
// pkg/engine/game.go:22-31 - Game struct has NO MenuSystem field
type Game struct {
	World          *World
	// ... other systems ...
	TutorialSystem      *TutorialSystem
	HelpSystem          *HelpSystem
	// MenuSystem is missing here
}

// pkg/engine/game.go:97-121 - Draw never renders menu
func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
	// ... renders terrain, entities, HUD, tutorial, help, inventory, quests ...
	// But never renders menu system
}

// pkg/engine/menu_system.go:1-502 - Full implementation exists but unused
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 10 (Critical - documented feature missing) × User Impact: 7.0 (save/load is core feature + usability issue) × Production Risk: 5 (feature works but UX is poor) - Complexity: 5 (just needs instantiation + key binding + rendering call)
- Final Score: 147.0

### Gap #3: Performance Claims Unverified (106 FPS with 2000 Entities) [Priority Score: 89.6]
**Severity:** Functional Mismatch
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "Validated 60+ FPS with 2000 entities (106 FPS achieved)" (README.md:53)
> "60+ FPS validation (106 FPS with 2000 entities)" (README.md:242)

**Implementation Location:** `cmd/perftest/main.go:1-169`

**Expected Behavior:** Performance test should validate and report achieving 106 FPS with 2000 entities as claimed in README.

**Actual Implementation:** Performance test tool exists but:
1. Default entity count is 1000, not 2000 (line 14: `entityCount = flag.Int("entities", 1000, ...)`)
2. No documented test run showing 106 FPS with 2000 entities
3. Test only checks for "60 FPS target met" (lines 76, 136) - never validates or mentions 106 FPS claim
4. No performance test results or benchmark output committed to repository

**Gap Details:** The README makes a very specific claim: "106 FPS with 2000 entities". This is repeated multiple times (lines 53, 242) as validation of Phase 8.5 completion. However:
- Running `./perftest` uses 1000 entities by default
- Running `./perftest -entities 2000` would be needed to test the claim
- No test output in docs/ shows this validation
- Target is hardcoded to 60 FPS, not 106 FPS
- Claim appears unverified

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
# Run default performance test
./perftest -duration 10

# Output: "Target: 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame)"
# Never mentions or validates 106 FPS claim
# Default is 1000 entities, not 2000
```

**Production Impact:** Medium - Performance might be adequate, but specific documented claim is unverified. Could mislead users about actual performance characteristics. If performance is actually worse than claimed, users may experience unexpected lag.

**Code Evidence:**
```go
// cmd/perftest/main.go:14 - Default is 1000, not 2000
entityCount = flag.Int("entities", 1000, "Number of entities to spawn")

// cmd/perftest/main.go:76, 136 - Only checks 60 FPS, never mentions 106
log.Printf("Target: 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame)")
fmt.Printf("\nPerformance Target (60 FPS): ")
if metrics.IsPerformanceTarget() {
	fmt.Printf("✅ MET (%.2f FPS)\n", metrics.FPS)
}
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 7 (Functional mismatch - claim vs implementation) × User Impact: 4.0 (performance expectations) × Production Risk: 8 (misleading documentation) - Complexity: 2 (just needs test run + documentation)
- Final Score: 89.6

### Gap #4: README Claims Default Client Resolution 1024x768 But Actual Default Is 800x600 [Priority Score: 63.0]
**Severity:** Functional Mismatch
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "./venture-client -width 1024 -height 768 -seed 12345" (README.md:656)

**Implementation Location:** `cmd/client/main.go:19-20`

**Expected Behavior:** README example shows running client with 1024x768, implying this is the standard/recommended resolution.

**Actual Implementation:** Default resolution is 800x600 (line 19-20: `width = flag.Int("width", 800, ...)` and `height = flag.Int("height", 600, ...)`).

**Gap Details:** The README's primary usage example shows `-width 1024 -height 768` which implies these are good/recommended values. However, the actual defaults are significantly smaller (800x600). This is inconsistent and could confuse users. Either the example should use the actual defaults (show 800x600 or omit the flags), or the defaults should match the documented example.

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
# README example (line 656):
./venture-client -width 1024 -height 768 -seed 12345

# But running without flags gives different size:
./venture-client -seed 12345
# Creates 800x600 window, not 1024x768
```

**Production Impact:** Low - Users can override with flags, but documentation inconsistency causes confusion about recommended settings.

**Code Evidence:**
```go
// cmd/client/main.go:19-20
width   = flag.Int("width", 800, "Screen width")
height  = flag.Int("height", 600, "Screen height")
// Defaults are 800x600, not 1024x768 as shown in README example
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 7 (Functional mismatch - doc vs code) × User Impact: 3.0 (minor UX confusion) × Production Risk: 3 (documentation only) - Complexity: 0.2 (trivial fix: change defaults or update README)
- Final Score: 63.0

### Gap #5: Save/Load Coverage Claim Discrepancy [Priority Score: 52.5]
**Severity:** Functional Mismatch
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "84.4% test coverage (18 tests)" (README.md:65)

**Implementation Location:** `pkg/saveload/` package

**Expected Behavior:** Save/load package should have exactly 84.4% test coverage as stated in README.

**Actual Implementation:** Running `go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/saveload/` reports: "coverage: 84.4% of statements" - this matches. However, the claim is listed under "Previous Completion: Phase 8.4" suggesting it's final/stable, but no verification that coverage hasn't regressed.

**Gap Details:** Coverage matches documented claim (84.4%), but:
1. No automated coverage verification in CI/CD
2. Coverage could silently regress below documented amount
3. README claims specific coverage as achievement but doesn't enforce it

This is more of a process gap than implementation gap - the claim is currently accurate but not protected.

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/saveload/
# Output: coverage: 84.4% of statements
# Matches README claim but no enforcement
```

**Production Impact:** Low - Coverage is currently accurate, but could regress without detection. Documentation would become stale.

**Code Evidence:**
```bash
# Current output:
ok      github.com/opd-ai/venture/pkg/saveload  (cached)        coverage: 84.4% of statements
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 7 (Functional mismatch - potential future) × User Impact: 2.5 (developer concern only) × Production Risk: 3 (code quality) - Complexity: 2 (add coverage check to CI)
- Final Score: 52.5

---

### Gap #6: Engine Coverage Lower Than Documented [Priority Score: 45.5]
**Severity:** Partial Implementation
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "80.4% test coverage for engine package" (README.md:54)
> "Target coverage: 80%+" (README.md in copilot-instructions.md)

**Implementation Location:** `pkg/engine/` package

**Expected Behavior:** Engine package should have 80.4% test coverage as stated in README Phase 8.5 completion.

**Actual Implementation:** Running `go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/engine/` reports: "coverage: 77.4% of statements". This is below both the documented 80.4% AND the general 80% target threshold.

**Gap Details:** The README explicitly states Phase 8.5 achieved "80.4% test coverage for engine package". However, actual current coverage is 77.4%, which is:
- 3.0% below the documented achievement
- 2.6% below the general 80% target threshold

This suggests either:
1. Tests were removed/deleted after Phase 8.5 documentation was written
2. Code was added without tests
3. Documentation was aspirational rather than actual

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/engine/
# Output: coverage: 77.4% of statements
# README claims: 80.4%
# Shortfall: 3.0%
```

**Production Impact:** Medium - Core engine has inadequate test coverage. Could hide bugs in game loop, ECS, or system interactions.

**Code Evidence:**
```bash
# Actual current coverage:
ok      github.com/opd-ai/venture/pkg/engine    0.028s  coverage: 77.4% of statements

# README.md line 54 claims:
# "80.4% test coverage for engine package"
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 5 (Partial - close but below threshold) × User Impact: 3.5 (code quality affects stability) × Production Risk: 5 (potential hidden bugs) - Complexity: 3.5 (need to write missing tests)
- Final Score: 45.5

---

### Gap #7: Network Package Coverage Below Minimum Threshold [Priority Score: 38.5]
**Severity:** Partial Implementation
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "Target minimum 80% code coverage per package" (copilot-instructions.md line 4)
> "Network package now at 66.8% coverage with all core functionality complete." (README.md:213)

**Implementation Location:** `pkg/network/` package

**Expected Behavior:** All packages should meet 80% coverage target. README acknowledges network is at 66.8% but claims "all core functionality complete".

**Actual Implementation:** Running `go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/network/` reports: "coverage: 66.8% of statements". This is 13.2% below the 80% target threshold.

**Gap Details:** The README acknowledges the network package is below target (66.8% vs 80%), but justifies it as requiring "integration tests for full coverage (I/O operations)". This is a valid reason, but the gap still exists. The package has 33.2% of code untested, which is substantial for a critical multiplayer system.

The note "*Note: Client/server require integration tests for full coverage (I/O operations)" suggests tests exist but aren't being run, OR tests need to be written but are deferred.

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/network/
# Output: coverage: 66.8% of statements
# Target: 80%
# Gap: 13.2%
```

**Production Impact:** Medium - Multiplayer networking is complex and error-prone. 33% untested code could hide critical bugs in production under network stress.

**Code Evidence:**
```bash
# Actual coverage:
ok      github.com/opd-ai/venture/pkg/network   (cached)        coverage: 66.8% of statements

# Target from copilot-instructions.md:
# "Target minimum 80% code coverage per package"
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 5 (Partial - significant gap but acknowledged) × User Impact: 4.0 (multiplayer reliability) × Production Risk: 5 (network bugs are critical) - Complexity: 6 (integration tests are complex)
- Final Score: 38.5

---

### Gap #8: Server Example Uses 1024x768 Resolution But Can't Set Screen Size [Priority Score: 0.0]
**Severity:** Silent Failure
**Documentation Reference:** 
> "./venture-client -width 1024 -height 768 -seed 12345" (README.md:656)
> "Start a dedicated server: ./venture-server -port 8080 -max-players 4" (README.md:659)

**Implementation Location:** `cmd/server/main.go:15-20`

**Expected Behavior:** Server is headless and doesn't need screen size flags. Documentation correctly shows server without screen size flags.

**Actual Implementation:** Server correctly has no width/height flags. This is not a gap - it's correct implementation. Marking severity as Silent Failure because it could confuse users who might wonder why server doesn't have screen size flags when client does.

**Gap Details:** This is actually correct behavior. Server is headless and doesn't render graphics, so it doesn't need or accept width/height flags. Documentation correctly shows the difference between client flags and server flags.

**Reproduction Scenario:**
```bash
./venture-server -help
# Correctly shows: port, max-players, seed, genre, tick-rate, verbose
# No width/height flags (correct for headless server)
```

**Production Impact:** None - This is correct implementation. No gap exists.

**Code Evidence:**
```go
// cmd/server/main.go:15-20 - Correctly omits screen size flags
var (
	port       = flag.String("port", "8080", "Server port")
	maxPlayers = flag.Int("max-players", 4, "Maximum number of players")
	seed       = flag.Int64("seed", 12345, "World generation seed")
	genreID    = flag.String("genre", "fantasy", "Genre ID for world generation")
	tickRate   = flag.Int("tick-rate", 20, "Server update rate (updates per second)")
	verbose    = flag.Bool("verbose", false, "Enable verbose logging")
)
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- Severity: 8 (Silent failure - no error for missing feature) × User Impact: 0.0 (no actual impact - correct behavior) × Production Risk: 0 (no risk) - Complexity: 0
- Final Score: 0.0

## Summary of High-Priority Gaps

The three highest-priority gaps requiring immediate attention are:

1. **Gap #1 (168.0)**: Client cannot connect to multiplayer servers - completely blocking multiplayer functionality
2. **Gap #2 (147.0)**: Menu system implemented but not integrated - poor save/load UX
3. **Gap #3 (89.6)**: Unverified performance claims - potentially misleading documentation

These three gaps represent:
- 1 completely missing critical feature (multiplayer client connection)
- 1 orphaned implementation (menu system exists but unused)
- 1 unverified claim (performance numbers)

**Recommended Repair Priority:**
1. Gap #1 - Enable multiplayer (highest business impact)
2. Gap #2 - Integrate menu system (improves UX significantly)
3. Gap #3 - Verify or correct performance claims (documentation accuracy)

Additional gaps (#4-#7) are lower priority documentation/testing issues that should be addressed but don't block core functionality.
