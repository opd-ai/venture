- Save files stored in `./saves/quicksave.sav` (JSON format, human-readable)
- Full player state persistence (position, health, stats, level, XP, inventory, equipment)
- World state persistence (seed, genre, dimensions) for deterministic regeneration

---

## Remaining Gaps Analysis

### ⚠️ Gap #4: Full Save/Load Menu UI (Priority 98.0)
**Status:** PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
**What Works:**
- Quick save/load via F5/F9 fully functional
- SaveManager can handle multiple named saves
- Save file browsing API available

**What's Missing:**
- GUI menu for browsing multiple saves
- Save slot selection (currently only "quicksave")
- Named saves through UI
- Save file deletion through UI

**Recommendation:**
- Current F5/F9 implementation covers core save/load use case
- Full menu UI is enhancement for future polish phase
- Priority: Medium (nice to have, not critical)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
- Implement save/load menu UI component
- Add save slot selection (10 slots)
- Add save naming dialog
- Add save deletion confirmation

---

### ⚠️ Gap #5: Performance Monitoring Integration (Priority 84.0)
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED
**What Exists:**
- `pkg/engine/performance.go` - Full PerformanceMonitor implementation
- Performance telemetry system complete
- Metrics tracking (FPS, frame time, entity count, memory)

**What's Missing:**
- PerformanceMonitor not instantiated in client/server
- No FPS display or performance logging
- "106 FPS with 2000 entities" claim unverified

**Recommendation:**
- Add performance monitoring to validate performance claims
- Useful for debugging and optimization
- Priority: Low-Medium (nice for validation, not user-facing)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
```go
// In cmd/client/main.go
perfMonitor := engine.NewPerformanceMonitor(game.World)
game.World.AddSystem(perfMonitor)

// In game loop
if frameCount % 60 == 0 {
    metrics := perfMonitor.GetMetrics()
    log.Printf("FPS: %.1f, Entities: %d", metrics.FPS, metrics.EntityCount)
}
```

---

### ⚠️ Gap #6: Spatial Partitioning Usage (Priority 73.5)
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED
**What Exists:**
- `pkg/engine/spatial_partition.go` - Full Quadtree implementation
- O(log n) entity queries fully tested
- Used successfully in `cmd/perftest`

**What's Missing:**
- SpatialPartitionSystem not used in client/server
- Collision detection still O(n²) instead of O(log n)
- Performance target "106 FPS with 2000 entities" may not be achievable

**Recommendation:**
- Enable when entity counts grow beyond ~100
- Currently not critical (typical game has <50 entities)
- Priority: Low (optimization, not functional requirement)

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days
```go
// In cmd/client/main.go (after terrain generation)
spatialSystem := engine.NewSpatialPartitionSystem(
    float64(generatedTerrain.Width * 32),   // world width in pixels
    float64(generatedTerrain.Height * 32),  // world height in pixels
)
game.World.AddSystem(spatialSystem)

// Modify collision system to use spatial partitioning
collisionSystem.EnableSpatialPartitioning(spatialSystem)
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Current: O(n²) collision checks → ~2,500 checks with 50 entities
- With Quadtree: O(n log n) → ~300 checks with 50 entities
- Becomes critical at 500+ entities: ~250,000 vs ~4,500 checks

---

### ⚠️ Gap #7: Documentation File Size Discrepancies (Priority 3.0)
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED
**Issue:** Minor discrepancies in documented file sizes
- USER_MANUAL.md: 18KB actual vs 17.6KB documented (+2.3%)
- API_REFERENCE.md: 20KB actual vs 20KB documented (matches ✓)
- CONTRIBUTING.md: 15KB actual vs 14.6KB documented (+2.7%)

**Recommendation:**
- Update README.md with current file sizes
- Purely cosmetic issue, no functional impact
- Priority: Trivial

**Estimated Effort:** 5 minutes
```markdown
# In README.md:30-32, update to:
- [x] User Manual (complete gameplay guide, 18KB)
- [x] API Reference (developer documentation, 20KB)
- [x] Contributing guidelines (comprehensive, 15KB)
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue #1: Save File Inventory Items Not Fully Restored
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Inventory item IDs are saved but full item restoration requires entity-item mapping not yet implemented.

**Impact:** Player gold and inventory slots are restored, but item details may need to be regenerated.

**Workaround:** Use deterministic item generation with world seed.

**Resolution Plan:** Add entity-item mapping in future phase.

---

### Issue #2: Tutorial Appears Every Launch
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Tutorial system doesn't track completion across sessions.

**Impact:** Tutorial shows every time client starts, even for experienced players.

**Workaround:** Press ESC to skip tutorial.

**Resolution Plan:** Add tutorial completion tracking to save file.

---

### Issue #3: No Auto-Save
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Only manual F5 quick save, no automatic saving.

**Impact:** Players can lose progress if they forget to save.

**Workaround:** Remind players to press F5 periodically.

**Resolution Plan:** Add auto-save every 5 minutes or on level transition (future phase).
