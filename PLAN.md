## Implementation Strategy

### Development Workflow

1. **Branch per Gap:** Create feature branch for each gap (e.g., `fix/gap-009-performance`)
2. **TDD Approach:** Write failing test → implement fix → verify test passes
3. **Incremental Commits:** Commit after each task completion
4. **Code Review:** Self-review against architectural patterns before merge
5. **Integration Testing:** Run full test suite after each merge

### Testing Protocol

```bash
# Unit Tests
go test ./pkg/...

# Coverage Check
go test -cover ./pkg/... | grep -E "(coverage|FAIL)"

# Performance Tests
go test -run TestRenderSystem_Performance ./pkg/engine

# Race Detection
go test -race ./...

# Full Build Validation
go build -o venture-client ./cmd/client
go build -o venture-server ./cmd/server
./venture-client -verbose
```

### Quality Gates

**Before Merge:**
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage targets met
- [ ] No race conditions
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Before Release:**
- [ ] All Phase 1 tasks complete

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

**Performance Optimization (GAP-009)**
- Risk: Changes may introduce visual artifacts
- Mitigation: Visual regression testing, incremental optimization

**Spell System Changes (GAP-001, GAP-002, GAP-003)**
- Risk: Balance issues with new effects
- Mitigation: Playtesting, tunable constants

**Test Coverage (GAP-012, GAP-011)**
- Risk: Time-consuming, may delay release
- Mitigation: Prioritize critical paths, use test doubles

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:
1. Revert problematic changes
2. Release 1.0.0 without optional enhancements
3. Address issues in 1.0.1 patch
4. Maintain feature flags for experimental systems
