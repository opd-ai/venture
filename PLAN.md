# Implementation Plan - Critical Gaps & Bugs

**Project:** Venture - Procedural Action RPG  
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 8 Polish & Optimization - Moving to Production Release  
**Priority:** Game-breaking bugs first, then core mechanics, then polish

---

## 1. Death & Revival System (CRITICAL - Priority 1)

### Issue Identification
**Current State:** Death detection exists (`IsDead()` method), but no immobilization or action prevention. No loot drops. No revival mechanics.

**Impact:** Players/monsters can attack while dead. No consequence for death. Multiplayer revival mentioned in docs but not implemented.

### Root Cause
- Death callback exists but only triggers cleanup, not state changes
- No "dead" state component to disable actions
- No item spawning system for dropped loot
- No proximity detection for revival mechanics

### Implementation Steps

**1.1 Death State Component** (`pkg/engine/death_component.go`)
```go
type DeadComponent struct {
    TimeOfDeath float64
    DroppedItems []uint64 // Entity IDs of dropped items
}
```

**1.2 Movement Prevention** (Modify `pkg/engine/movement.go`)
- Check for DeadComponent before applying movement
- Return early if entity has dead state

**1.3 Combat Prevention** (Modify `pkg/engine/combat_system.go`)
- Skip dead entities in Update loop
- Prevent dead entities from being attack targets
- Block action inputs for dead player entities

**1.4 Loot Drop System** (Modify death callback in `cmd/client/main.go`)
- Access inventory component from dead entity
- Create item entities at death position with physics
- Add dropped items to world
- Clear inventory after spawning items

**1.5 Multiplayer Revival** (New system in `pkg/engine/revival_system.go`)
```go
type RevivalSystem struct {
    revivalRange float64 // 32.0 units
    revivalAmount float64 // 0.2 (20% health)
}
```
- Check proximity between living teammates and dead players
- Require input action (E key) to revive
- Restore 20% health and remove DeadComponent
- Network sync revival events

### Testing
- Unit test: Dead entity cannot move/attack
- Integration test: Loot spawns at death location
- Multiplayer test: Revival mechanics with 2 clients
- Performance test: Death with 100+ entities doesn't drop FPS

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Dead entities frozen in place
- ✅ Dead entities drop inventory items
- ⏳ Living players can revive dead teammates (IN PROGRESS)
- ⏳ Network synchronized across clients (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ No performance impact (<1ms per death)

- **Features:**
  - Idempotent callback with `HasComponent("dead")` guard to prevent multiple executions
  - Tracks dropped items in `DeadComponent.DroppedItems` list
  - **Inventory Items:** Drops all inventory items in circular scatter pattern
    - Uses trigonometry for even distribution: `2π * i / itemCount`
    - Initial velocity: 150 units/sec outward from death position
    - Friction coefficient: 0.12 for realistic deceleration
  - **Equipped Items:** Drops equipped weapon and armor from opposite sides
    - Weapon drops left (-80 units), armor drops right (+80 units)

## 2. Input System Fixes (HIGH - Priority 2)

### Issue Identification
**Current State:** Input system exists but has documented bugs (GAP-001, GAP-002) with frame-persistent vs immediate consumption flags. Tutorial may miss key presses.

**Gaps:**
- UI labels may not match actual keybindings
- Menu navigation focus issues
- Input conflicts between game states
- No input buffering for combat responsiveness

### Root Cause
- Action flags consumed before all systems read them
- No centralized key binding registry
- State machine doesn't block inputs properly
- Tutorial checks flags after consumption

### Implementation Steps

**2.1 Key Binding Registry** (`pkg/engine/keybindings.go`)
- Central mapping of actions to keys
- UI automatically reads from registry
- Support remapping (future enhancement)

**2.2 Input State Separation** (Modify `pkg/engine/input_system.go`)
- Keep frame-persistent flags for UI/tutorial (already partially done)
- Separate consumption flags for gameplay systems
- Add input buffer (last 3 frames) for combo detection

**2.3 State-Based Input Filtering** (Modify `pkg/engine/input_system.go`)
```go
type GameState int
const (
    StateExploring = iota
    StateCombat
    StateMenu
    StateDialogue
)
```
- Block game inputs when menu open
- Allow only menu navigation during menu state
- Prevent movement during dialogue

**2.4 UI Label Validation** (Audit all UI systems)
- Map UI: Check keybinding display matches InputSystem
- Inventory UI: Verify key labels
- Skills UI: Confirm hotkey display
- Help System: Validate all key references

### Testing
- Manual test: Press all keys in all game states
- Automated test: Input consumption order
- Tutorial test: Complete tutorial without missed inputs
- UI test: All labels match actual bindings

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Tutorial completes without input issues
- ✅ UI labels 100% accurate
- ✅ No input conflicts between states
- ✅ Menu navigation smooth and responsive

## 3. Status Effects System (MEDIUM - Priority 3)

### Issue Identification
**Current State:** Status effects implemented (burning, poison, buffs) but potential edge cases with stacking, expiration, and conflicts.

**Potential Issues:**
- Multiple same-type effects may stack incorrectly
- Stat modifiers may not cleanly revert
- Network desync on effect application
- Visual feedback missing for some effects

### Root Cause
- Effect refresh logic overwrites instead of stacking
- Removal multiplies instead of subtracting modifiers
- No validation of stat values after effect removal

### Implementation Steps

**3.1 Stacking Validation** (Modify `pkg/engine/status_effect_system.go`)
- Track effect stacks per entity
- Decide stacking rules: refresh duration, stack magnitude, or ignore
- Add max stack limits per effect type

**3.2 Stat Modifier Tracking** (New component in `pkg/engine/combat_components.go`)
```go
type StatModifierTracker struct {
    BaseAttack float64
    BaseDefense float64
    ActiveModifiers map[string]float64 // effectID -> modifier
}
```
- Store base stats before modifications
- Track each effect's contribution
- Recalculate stats when effects change

**3.3 Network Synchronization** (Modify `pkg/network/protocol.go`)
- Add status effect application messages
- Sync effect timers periodically
- Validate effect state on client reconciliation

**3.4 Visual Feedback** (Connect to particle system)
- Burning: Fire particles
- Poison: Green drip particles
- Buffs: Glow aura
- Debuffs: Dark swirls

### Testing
- Edge case: Apply strength buff twice
- Edge case: Effect expires during combat
- Network test: Effect sync with 200ms latency
- Visual test: All effects show particles

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Effects stack/refresh correctly
- ✅ Stats revert to exact base values
- ✅ Network synchronized
- ✅ Visual feedback for all effects

## 4. Fog of War System (MEDIUM - Priority 4)

### Issue Identification
**Current State:** Fog of war mentioned in save/load (GAP-005), MapUI has GetFogOfWar/SetFogOfWar methods, but visibility calculations may be buggy.

**Suspected Issues:**
- FOW not updating during gameplay
- Visibility range incorrect
- Rendering artifacts
- Not integrated with lighting system

### Root Cause
- MapUI fog system not connected to movement
- No tile exploration tracking in movement system
- Rendering may not respect fog state

### Implementation Steps

**4.1 Visibility Calculation** (Modify `pkg/engine/movement.go`)
- Track player position changes
- Mark tiles as explored in radius (e.g., 8 tiles)
- Call MapUI.ExploreTile() for each visible tile

**4.2 Rendering Integration** (Modify rendering system)
- Unexplored tiles: Fully black
- Explored but not visible: 50% darkened
- Currently visible: Full brightness
- Add subtle fog texture overlay

**4.3 Performance Optimization**
- Only recalculate FOW when player moves
- Cache visible tile set
- Use spatial partitioning for large maps

### Testing
- Visual test: FOW updates as player moves
- Save/load test: FOW state persists
- Performance test: FOW calculation <0.5ms per frame

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Fog reveals as player explores
- ✅ Explored areas remain visible but dimmed
- ✅ No rendering artifacts
- ✅ Saves/loads correctly

## 5. Combat Calculations Validation (LOW - Priority 5)

### Issue Identification
**Current State:** Combat system fully implemented with damage, defense, criticals. Need validation of edge cases.

**Potential Issues:**
- Negative damage from high defense
- Critical hit calculation edge cases
- Resistance overflow (>100%)
- Shield absorption edge cases

### Implementation Steps

**5.1 Damage Formula Audit** (`pkg/engine/combat_system.go`)
- Ensure minimum damage (1.0) even with high defense
- Cap resistance at 90% (not 100%)
- Validate critical damage multipliers
- Test edge cases with extreme stats

**5.2 Shield System Validation** 
- Verify shield absorbs before health
- Test shield expiration during damage
- Check shield + resistance interaction

**5.3 Add Combat Logging**
- Debug flag for damage calculations
- Log: raw damage, after defense, after resistance, final
- Helps identify balance issues

### Testing
- Unit test: Extreme stat values
- Unit test: Shield edge cases
- Balance test: Damage feels appropriate at all levels

### Success Criteria
- ✅ No negative or zero damage bugs
- ✅ All edge cases handled gracefully
- ✅ Combat feels balanced

---

## 6. System Integration Audit (LOW - Priority 6)

### Issue Identification
**Current State:** Network prediction and lag compensation implemented. Need testing of death/revival sync.

**Requirements:**
- Death state synchronized
- Revival actions validated by server
- Dropped items spawned on all clients
- No desync during combat

### Implementation Steps

**7.1 Death Event Protocol**
- Client predicts death locally
- Server validates and broadcasts
- All clients spawn loot items deterministically

**7.2 Revival Action Protocol**
- Client sends revival request with target ID
- Server validates proximity and living state
- Server broadcasts revival to all clients
- Clients update health and remove dead state

**7.3 Testing**
- 2 clients: simultaneous death
- 2 clients: revival during enemy attack
- High latency: death with 1000ms delay

### Success Criteria
