## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Run tests
go test -tags test ./pkg/...

# Build client
go build -o venture-client ./cmd/client

# Build server
go build -o venture-server ./cmd/server

# Run tests with coverage
go test -tags test -cover ./pkg/...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -tags test -race ./pkg/...
```

## Next Phase (Phase 2)

### Objectives
Implement procedural generation systems for all game content.

### Tasks (Weeks 3-5)
- [ ] Terrain/dungeon generation (BSP, cellular automata)
- [ ] Entity generator (monsters, NPCs)
- [ ] Item generation (weapons, armor, stats)
- [ ] Magic/spell generation
- [ ] Skill tree generation
- [ ] Genre definition system
- [ ] Unit tests for all generators

### Expected Deliverables
- Working terrain generation with multiple algorithms
- Monster and NPC generation with stats
- Item generation with procedural properties
- Magic system with spell combinations
- Skill tree with progression paths
- Genre templates for 5+ themes
- CLI tool for testing generation offline

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope Creep | ✅ Low | MVP defined, clear roadmap |
| Performance | ✅ Low | Targets set, profiling planned |
| Network Complexity | ✅ Low | Phased approach in Phase 6 |
| Generation Quality | ✅ Low | Validation built into interfaces |
| Integration | ✅ Low | Modular design, clear boundaries |

---

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 80% | 94.2% | ✅ |
| Build Time | <1 min | <5 sec | ✅ |
| Documentation | Complete | 1,738 lines | ✅ |
| Code Quality | High | golangci-lint clean | ✅ |

## Team Notes

### Completed Well
- ✅ Clean architecture with ECS pattern
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Modular package structure
- ✅ Good test coverage
- ✅ Clear roadmap

### Lessons Learned
- Build tags essential for CI testing with Ebiten
- Deterministic generation critical for multiplayer
- Clear interfaces prevent circular dependencies
- Documentation up-front saves time later

### Recommendations for Phase 2
1. Start with terrain generation (most visible progress)
2. Build validation into generators early
3. Create visualization tools for debugging generation
4. Test determinism continuously
5. Benchmark generation performance
