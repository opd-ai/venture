# Accessibility Features

**Version:** 2.0 Phase 10.3  
**Date:** November 1, 2025

## Overview

Venture includes comprehensive accessibility settings for players with motion sensitivity or other needs. These features follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) recommendations for motion effects in games.

## Accessibility Settings

### Screen Shake Intensity

Control the intensity of screen shake effects from explosions, hits, and combat.

- **Default:** 1.0 (full intensity)
- **Range:** 0.0 - unlimited
  - `0.0` = Screen shake disabled
  - `0.5` = Half intensity (recommended for motion sensitivity)
  - `1.0` = Full intensity (default)
  - `>1.0` = Enhanced intensity (for players who want more feedback)

**Use Case:** Players with motion sickness or vestibular disorders can reduce or disable screen shake while maintaining other visual feedback.

### Hit-Stop Effects

Enable or disable hit-stop (brief time freeze on critical hits and explosions).

- **Default:** Enabled
- **Options:** Enabled / Disabled

**Use Case:** Players who find time freezes disruptive can disable them while keeping other combat feedback.

### Visual Flash Effects

Enable or disable flash effects when taking damage.

- **Default:** Enabled
- **Options:** Enabled / Disabled

**Use Case:** Players sensitive to bright flashes or with photosensitive conditions can disable damage flashes.

### Reduced Motion Mode

Master switch that disables ALL camera effects when enabled.

- **Default:** Disabled
- **Options:** Enabled / Disabled
- **Effect:** Overrides all other settings, disabling:
  - Screen shake
  - Hit-stop
  - Visual flashes
  - Any other motion-based effects

**Use Case:** Implements WCAG "prefers-reduced-motion" standard for players who need minimal motion effects.

## How to Configure (Programmatic)

```go
// Get accessibility settings from camera system
camera := game.CameraSystem
settings := camera.Accessibility

// Reduce screen shake to 30% (motion sensitivity)
settings.SetScreenShakeIntensity(0.3)

// Disable hit-stop (time freeze)
settings.SetHitStopEnabled(false)

// Keep visual flash enabled
settings.SetVisualFlashEnabled(true)

// OR: Enable reduced motion mode (disables everything)
settings.SetReducedMotion(true)
```

## Default Settings

By default, all effects are **enabled** for the full intended experience:
- Screen Shake: 1.0 (full intensity)
- Hit-Stop: Enabled
- Visual Flash: Enabled
- Reduced Motion: Disabled

Players who need accommodations can adjust settings as needed.

## Technical Details

### Client-Local Effects

All accessibility settings are **client-local** (not synchronized in multiplayer):
- Each player can configure their own accessibility preferences
- Settings do not affect other players
- No network bandwidth impact
- No gameplay balance impact

### Performance

Accessibility features have **zero performance cost**:
- Disabled effects are skipped entirely (early return)
- Reduced intensity effects use simple multiplication
- No allocations in hot paths
- <0.1ms frame time impact

### WCAG Compliance

Venture's accessibility system implements key WCAG 2.1 guidelines:
- **Guideline 2.3:** Seizures and Physical Reactions
  - Reduced Motion mode provides alternative with minimal motion
  - Visual flash can be disabled
- **Guideline 2.2:** Enough Time
  - Hit-stop can be disabled if time freezes are problematic

## Recommendations by Condition

### Motion Sickness / Vestibular Disorders
```go
settings.SetScreenShakeIntensity(0.2)  // Minimal shake
settings.SetHitStopEnabled(false)       // No time freeze
settings.SetVisualFlashEnabled(true)    // Keep flashes (static)
```

### Photosensitive Epilepsy
```go
settings.SetScreenShakeIntensity(0.5)  // Reduce shake
settings.SetHitStopEnabled(true)        // Keep hit-stop
settings.SetVisualFlashEnabled(false)   // Disable flashes
```

### General Discomfort with Motion
```go
settings.SetReducedMotion(true)  // Disable all motion effects
```

### Power Users (Want More Feedback)
```go
settings.SetScreenShakeIntensity(1.5)  // Enhanced shake
settings.SetHitStopEnabled(true)        // Keep hit-stop
settings.SetVisualFlashEnabled(true)    // Keep flashes
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future additions (not currently implemented):
- UI menu for accessibility settings
- Presets (Comfort, Balanced, Intense, Disabled)
- Per-effect intensity control
- Colorblind modes for flash colors
- Audio alternatives to visual effects
