# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Entity-Component-System (ECS) Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The game requires a flexible architecture to handle diverse procedurally-generated content including entities, items, abilities, and behaviors. Traditional object-oriented hierarchies would become unwieldy with the variety of possible combinations.

**Decision:**
Implement an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture where:
- **Entities** are unique identifiers with component collections
- **Components** are pure data structures (position, health, sprite, etc.)
- **Systems** contain behavior logic and operate on entities with specific components

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Excellent composition flexibility, cache-friendly data access, easy to add new content types
- **Positive:** Parallel system execution potential
- **Negative:** More verbose than traditional OOP for simple cases
- **Negative:** Requires discipline to avoid putting logic in components

## ADR-002: Pure Go with No External Assets

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Requirements specify 100% procedural generation for graphics and audio, with no external asset files.

**Decision:**
All visual and audio content will be generated at runtime using:
- Procedural graphics via Ebiten's image manipulation
- Waveform synthesis for audio
- Algorithmic generation seeded for determinism

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Single binary distribution, no asset pipeline
- **Positive:** Infinite content variety within generation rules
- **Negative:** Higher CPU/memory usage for generation
- **Negative:** Initial generation time on startup
- **Mitigation:** Cache generated assets, lazy generation, progressive loading

## ADR-003: Client-Server Network Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Multiplayer support required with high-latency tolerance (200-5000ms) for co-op gameplay, including support for slow connections like onion services (Tor).

**Decision:**
Implement authoritative server model with client-side prediction:
- Server maintains canonical game state
- Clients predict local actions for responsiveness
- Server reconciliation corrects prediction errors
- Entity interpolation smooths network jitter

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Prevents cheating, consistent game state
- **Positive:** Works well with high latency through prediction
- **Negative:** More complex than peer-to-peer
- **Negative:** Requires dedicated server for multiplayer

## ADR-004: Package-Based Module Organization

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Large codebase needs clear organization and separation of concerns.

**Decision:**
Use `pkg/` directory with domain-focused packages:
- `engine/` - Core ECS and game loop
- `procgen/` - All generation systems
- `rendering/` - Visual output
- `audio/` - Sound synthesis
- `network/` - Multiplayer
- `combat/` - Combat mechanics
- `world/` - World state

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Clear responsibility boundaries
- **Positive:** Easier testing and reusability
- **Positive:** Supports parallel development
- **Negative:** Requires careful interface design to avoid circular dependencies

## ADR-005: Deterministic Generation with Seeds

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need reproducible content for multiplayer sync and testing.

**Decision:**
All procedural generation uses deterministic algorithms with seed values:
- Base world seed derives all other seeds
- Each content type gets independent but deterministic sub-seeds
- Same seed always produces same content

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Multiplayer clients can generate same content independently
- **Positive:** Easy to reproduce bugs and test scenarios
- **Positive:** Share interesting worlds via seed sharing
- **Negative:** Must avoid using system time or other non-deterministic sources

## ADR-006: Genre System for Content Variation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Game should support multiple adventure genres (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, etc.) with appropriate theming.

**Decision:**
Implement genre as a modifier system that affects:
- Visual palette and style
- Audio themes and instruments
- Entity naming and types
- Item and ability flavoring
- Environment themes

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Huge variety from same generation systems
- **Positive:** Player can choose preferred setting
- **Negative:** Requires careful abstraction of generation rules
- **Negative:** Need to validate all genre combinations work

## ADR-007: Performance Targets

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Game should run on modest hardware (Intel i5/Ryzen 5, 8GB RAM, integrated graphics) to be accessible to a wide audience.

**Decision:**
Target specifications:
- 60 FPS minimum framerate
- <500MB client memory
- <1GB server memory (4 players)
- <2s world generation time
- <100KB/s per player network usage

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Accessible to wider audience
- **Positive:** Forces efficient algorithms
- **Negative:** May limit graphical complexity
- **Negative:** Requires careful optimization
