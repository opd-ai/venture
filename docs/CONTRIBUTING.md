## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.7 or later
- Git for version control
- See [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete setup instructions

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork and set up development environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/venture.git
   cd venture
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/opd-ai/venture.git
   ```

**For complete development environment setup, dependencies, build instructions, testing workflows, profiling, and debugging, see [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).**

## Making Changes

### Project Philosophy

Venture follows these core principles:

1. **Deterministic Generation**: All procedural generation must use seed-based deterministic algorithms
2. **ECS Architecture**: Maintain separation between entities, components, and systems
3. **Performance First**: Target 60 FPS with 2000+ entities
4. **No External Assets**: Everything generated at runtime
5. **Multiplayer Support**: Consider network synchronization

### Types of Contributions

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fix broken functionality
- Resolve crashes or errors
- Improve stability

**Features:**
- New game mechanics
- Additional content generators
- UI improvements
- Performance optimizations

**Documentation:**
- Improve existing docs
- Add examples
- Write tutorials
- Fix typos

**Testing:**
- Add unit tests
- Create integration tests
- Improve test coverage
- Add benchmarks

### Deterministic Generation Rule

**CRITICAL:** All procedural generation must be deterministic!

```go
// ‚ùå BAD: Non-deterministic
func Generate() {
    value := rand.Intn(100) // Uses global random state
}

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Deterministic
func Generate(seed int64) {
    rng := rand.New(rand.NewSource(seed))
    value := rng.Intn(100)
}
```

Never use:
- `time.Now()` for randomness
- Global `math/rand` functions
- System-dependent randomness

Always use:
- Seeded `rand.New(rand.NewSource(seed))`
- Deterministic algorithms
- Same seed = same result

### ECS Guidelines

**Components:** Pure data structures

```go
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Only data
type PositionComponent struct {
    X, Y float64
}

func (p PositionComponent) Type() string {
    return "position"
}

// ‚ùå BAD: Logic in component
type PositionComponent struct {
    X, Y float64
}

func (p *PositionComponent) Move(dx, dy float64) {
    p.X += dx
    p.Y += dy
}
```

**Systems:** Contain all logic

```go
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Logic in system
type MovementSystem struct{}

func (s *MovementSystem) Update(entities []*Entity, dt float64) {
    for _, entity := range entities {
        if !entity.HasComponent("position") || !entity.HasComponent("velocity") {
            continue
        }
        
        pos := entity.GetComponent("position").(*PositionComponent)
        vel := entity.GetComponent("velocity").(*VelocityComponent)
        
        pos.X += vel.VX * dt
        pos.Y += vel.VY * dt
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum per package
- **Test Tags**: Use `-tags test` for all tests
- **Table-Driven Tests**: For multiple scenarios
- **Benchmarks**: For performance-critical code

### Writing Tests

Write table-driven tests with good coverage. Always test that procedural generation is deterministic (same seed = same output). Add benchmarks for performance-critical code.

**For detailed testing examples, patterns, and best practices, see [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).**

---

## Code Style

Follow standard Go conventions: use `go fmt`, pass `go vet`, check all errors, document exported items.

**Key requirements:**
- Deterministic generation (same seed = same output)
- ECS architecture (separate entities, components, systems)
- 80% test coverage minimum
- No external assets (100% procedural)

**For detailed code style guidelines, documentation standards, and examples, see [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).**
