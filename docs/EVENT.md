Create a PLAN.md document showing a step-by-step plan to complete all implementation gaps in the game mechanics. Ensure that all systems are instantiated and connected. Ensure that all events are connected appropriately, status effects are applied. All inputs must be connected and correctly labeled in the UI. Pay very close attention to input and menu bugs related to game mechanics and user interaction. Resolve death mechanics: being reduced to 0 health should result in complete immobilization for both players and monsters, no attacks, spells or other actions should be possible, and all items should be dropped nearby. In multiplayer mode, being touched by a team-mate revives the character with 20% health. Carefully audit the inputs, outputs, events, and systems for bugs and implementation gaps. Ensure fog-of-war is functioning. Make sure all audio, visual, and storytelling procedural content systems are functioning correctly.
