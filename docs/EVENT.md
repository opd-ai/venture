Create a PLAN.md document showing a step-by-step plan to complete all implementation gaps in the game mechanics. Ensure that all systems are instantiated and connected. Ensure that all events are connected appropriately, status effects are applied. Being reduced to 0 health should result in complete immobilization for both players and monsters, no attacks, spells or other actions should be possible, and all items should be dropped nearby. Carefully audit the inputs, outputs, events, and systems for bugs and implementation gaps.
