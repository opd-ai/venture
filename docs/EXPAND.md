Create a PLAN.md document showing a step-by-step plan to expand on the game mechanics. First, add an interstitial "Splash" menu to startup with Single-Player and Multi-Player options. In the single-player submenu, add "New Game" and "Load Game" options. In the Multi-Player options, offer a "Server" field and a "Connect" button. Repurpose the tutorial into a combined "Interactive Character Creation Process+Onboarding Tutorial system." Character Creation should be possible in both single-player and multiplayer mode. After that we need shops and shopkeepers. Some shopkeepers should be fixed-location, others should be nomadic. Start with simple dialog mechanics using an interface type so more sophisticated mechanics can be added later. Add the ability to manipulate the environment, such as digging through walls with weapons or destructive spells, starting fires. It dshould alsos be possible to build walls using raw materials or magic. Add crafting mechanics for brewing potions, enanting weapons and armor, and crafting magic items like wands, rings, amulets.
