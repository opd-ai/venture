Create a PLAN.md document showing a step-by-step plan to expand on the game mechanics. Repurpose the tutorial into a combined "Interactive Character Creation Process+Onboarding Tutorial system." Character Creation should be possible in both single-player and multiplayer mode. Add the ability to manipulate the environment, such as digging through walls with weapons or destructive spells, starting fires. It should alsos be possible to build walls using raw materials or magic. Add crafting mechanics for brewing potions, enchanting weapons and armor, and crafting magic items like wands, rings, amulets.
