Create a comprehensive PLAN.md document outlining the implementation strategy for expanding Venture's game mechanics. The plan should follow this structured approach:

## Phase 1: Menu System & Game Modes
Implement a splash screen menu system as the initial player interface:
- **Main Menu**: Present "Single-Player" and "Multi-Player" options
- **Single-Player Submenu**: Include "New Game" and "Load Game" selections
- **Multi-Player Submenu**: Provide server connection interface with:
  - Text field for server address input
  - "Connect" button for initiating connection
  
Ensure the menu system integrates with existing client/server architecture and supports both local and networked gameplay.

## Phase 2: Character Creation & Tutorial Integration
Transform the existing tutorial system into a unified onboarding experience:
- Design an interactive character creation process that seamlessly transitions into gameplay
- Enable character creation in both single-player and multiplayer contexts
- Integrate tutorial mechanics that teach core gameplay during character creation
- Ensure the system is extensible for future customization options (appearance, stats, abilities)

## Phase 3: Commerce & NPC Interaction
Develop a shop and merchant system with varied NPC behaviors:
- **Fixed-Location Shopkeepers**: Establish permanent merchants in towns/settlements
- **Nomadic Merchants**: Create traveling vendors with dynamic spawn locations
- **Dialog System**: Implement interface-based dialog mechanics for future extensibility
  - Start with simple text-based interactions
  - Design the interface to support future enhancements (branching dialogs, voice, animations)
- Integrate with existing inventory and item generation systems

## Phase 4: Environmental Manipulation
Add destructive and constructive terrain interaction:
- **Destructive Actions**: Enable wall destruction through:
  - Weapon-based digging/breaking mechanics
  - Destructive spell effects on terrain
  - Fire propagation system with environmental consequences
- **Constructive Actions**: Allow terrain modification through:
  - Wall construction using raw materials
  - Magic-based terrain creation (earth/stone spells)
- Ensure multiplayer synchronization for environmental changes

## Phase 5: Crafting Systems
Implement comprehensive crafting mechanics:
- **Potion Brewing**: Recipe-based consumable creation
- **Equipment Enhancement**: Weapon and armor enchanting system
- **Magic Item Crafting**: Create wands, rings, amulets, and similar items
- Design crafting to integrate with:
  - Existing item generation system
  - Skill progression mechanics
  - Resource gathering/inventory management

Each phase should maintain deterministic generation principles, support multiplayer synchronization, and integrate with the existing ECS architecture. Include technical considerations for network state synchronization, client-side prediction, and performance optimization throughout.
