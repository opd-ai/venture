TASK: Autonomously diagnose and fix all build and test failures in the Go codebase.

EXECUTION MODE: Autonomous - automatically implement all fixes without requiring approval.

PROCESS:
0. Install build dependencies as indicated in CI config file or README.md
1. Run `go build` and `go test ./...` to identify failures
2. For each failure, determine root cause and implement fix
3. Verify fix resolves the issue without regressions
4. Proceed to next failure until all pass
5. Provide final summary report

REQUIREMENTS:
- Fix underlying issues, not symptoms
- Maintain existing functionality (no regressions)
- Follow Go best practices and idioms
- Preserve code style and patterns
- Ensure thread-safety and error handling

FIX PRIORITY:
1. Compilation errors (blocking all tests)
2. Import/dependency issues
3. Test failures (by package dependency order)
4. Race conditions or concurrency issues

VALIDATION (after each fix):
- Run affected tests to confirm resolution
- Run full test suite to detect regressions
- Verify `go build` still succeeds

OUTPUT FORMAT (final report):
```
## Build/Test Fixes Summary

**Total Issues Fixed:** [N]

### Fix #1: [Brief description]
- **File:** [path/to/file.go]
- **Issue:** [Error message/symptom]
- **Root Cause:** [Technical explanation]
- **Solution:** [What was changed]

### Fix #2: [...]

## Final Status:
✓ Build: [PASS/FAIL]
✓ Tests: [X/Y passing]
✓ Coverage: [unchanged/improved]
```

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✓ `go build` completes without errors
✓ `go test ./...` shows 100% pass rate
✓ No new failures introduced
✓ All fixes address root causes

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not modify test assertions unless they contain bugs
- Preserve public API compatibility
- Maintain existing dependencies where possible
