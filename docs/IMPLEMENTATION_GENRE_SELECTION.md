# Genre Selection Menu Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Phase**: 1.1 Enhancement  

## Overview

Successfully implemented a genre selection menu that allows players to choose their preferred game genre (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Cyberpunk, Post-Apocalyptic) before starting a new single-player game. The selected genre influences all procedural content generation throughout gameplay.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Genre Selection Menu Component (`pkg/engine/genre_selection_menu.go`)
- **Lines of Code**: 252
- **Genre Source**: `pkg/procgen/genre.DefaultRegistry()` (5 predefined genres)
- **Input Methods**:
  - Keyboard: Arrow keys, WASD, number shortcuts (1-5), Enter/Space to select, ESC to go back
  - Mouse: Click to select, hover to highlight
- **Features**:
  - Visual list with genre names and descriptions
  - Number shortcuts displayed for each genre
  - Selected genre highlight with color change
  - Controls hint at bottom of screen
  - Visibility state management (Show/Hide)
  - Callback system for selection and back navigation

### 2. State Machine Updates (`pkg/engine/app_state.go`)
- **New State**: `AppStateGenreSelection` (value 2)
- **Valid Transitions**:
  - `AppStateSinglePlayerMenu → AppStateGenreSelection` (New Game)
  - `AppStateGenreSelection → AppStateCharacterCreation` (Genre selected)
  - `AppStateGenreSelection → AppStateSinglePlayerMenu` (Back)
  - `AppStateGenreSelection → AppStateMainMenu` (Quit to main menu)
- **Updated Function**: `isValidAppTransition()` with new transition rules

### 3. Game Integration (`pkg/engine/game.go`)
- **New Fields**:
  - `GenreSelectionMenu *GenreSelectionMenu`: Menu component instance
  - `selectedGenreID string`: Storage for player's genre choice
- **New Handlers**:
  - `handleSinglePlayerMenuNewGame()`: Transition to genre selection (not character creation)
  - `handleGenreSelection(genreID string)`: Store genre and proceed to character creation
  - `handleGenreSelectionBack()`: Return to single-player menu
- **New Getter**:
  - `GetSelectedGenreID() string`: Retrieve stored genre and clear (one-time use)
- **Integration Points**:
  - Menu initialization in `NewEbitenGame()` and `NewEbitenGameWithLogger()`
  - Callback wiring for genre selection and back navigation
  - Update loop handling for `AppStateGenreSelection`
  - Draw loop rendering for `AppStateGenreSelection`

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (`pkg/engine/genre_selection_menu_test.go`)
- **Lines of Code**: 484
- **Test Functions**: 14
- **Benchmarks**: 2
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Initialization and defaults
  - Visibility state management
  - Callback registration and invocation
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, wrapping)
  - Mouse position detection (7 scenarios)
  - Genre selection logic
  - Integration with game state machine
  - Genre validation (all 5 expected genres present)
  - Genre storage and retrieval
- **Test Results**: 14/14 passing ✅
- **Performance**:
  - Genre selection: Measured via benchmark
  - Mouse detection: Measured via benchmark

    ↓ (Select "Single-Player")
Single-Player Menu
    ↓ (Select "New Game")
Genre Selection Menu ← NEW
    ↓ (Select genre: Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Horror/Cyberpunk/Post-Apoc)
Character Creation
    ↓
Gameplay
```

## Technical Details

### Genre System Integration
The selected genre ID is passed to all procedural generators through `GenerationParams`:

```go
genreID := game.GetSelectedGenreID()
params := procgen.GenerationParams{
    Difficulty: 0.5,
    Depth:      1,
    GenreID:    genreID, // Influences all generation
    Custom:     make(map[string]interface{}),
}
```

### State Transition Validation
Added transitions to `isValidAppTransition()`:
- From `AppStateSinglePlayerMenu`: Added `AppStateGenreSelection`
- New case for `AppStateGenreSelection`: Allows `AppStateCharacterCreation`, `AppStateSinglePlayerMenu`, `AppStateMainMenu`

### Layout Calculations
Screen dimensions: 1280x720  
Menu starting Y: 360 - 100 = 260  
Genre height: 50px  
Genre positions (Y coordinates):
- Fantasy: 260
- Sci-Fi: 310
- Horror: 360
- Cyberpunk: 410
- Post-Apocalyptic: 460

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual component methods tested in isolation
- Edge cases covered (out-of-bounds, nil screens, hidden state)
- String representations validated
- Callback invocation verified

### Integration Tests
- Full state transition flow tested
- Menu visibility state checked
- Genre storage and retrieval validated
- Callback wiring verified

### Coordinate Tests
- Mouse hit detection tested for all genres
- Out-of-bounds clicks tested (top, bottom, left, right)
- Exact genre boundary testing

### Performance Benchmarks
- Selection operation performance measured
- Mouse position detection performance measured

## Build Verification

```bash
✅ go build ./cmd/client - Success
✅ go test ./pkg/engine - 100% pass rate
✅ Coverage: 52.2% (engine package overall)
```

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Zero compiler warnings**
- **All tests passing**: 14/14 genre selection tests, 200+ total engine tests
- **No race conditions**: Tested with `-race` flag
- **Deterministic behavior**: Same input produces same output
- **Follows project conventions**: 
  - ECS architecture respected
  - State machine patterns followed
  - Godoc comments on all public APIs
  - Table-driven tests
  - Error handling best practices

## Integration Points for Other Systems

### World Generation
When starting a new game, call `GetSelectedGenreID()` to retrieve the player's genre choice:

```go
func (g *EbitenGame) startNewGame() {
    genreID := g.GetSelectedGenreID()
    if genreID == "" {
        genreID = "fantasy" // Default fallback
    }
    
    // Use genreID in GenerationParams for all generators
    g.world = generateWorld(g.worldSeed, genreID)
}
```

### Character Creation
Character creation screen can access the selected genre to influence:
- Starting equipment themed to genre
- Character class names (Warrior vs. Soldier)
- Skill tree names and descriptions
- Visual customization options

### Save/Load System (Phase 8.3)
When implementing save files, store the genre ID:

```json
{
    "worldSeed": 12345,
    "genreID": "scifi",
    "playerData": { ... }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified for future work:

1. **Genre Blending**: Allow selecting two genres for crossover themes
   - Already supported by `pkg/procgen/genre.BlendGenres()`
   - Needs UI for selecting primary + secondary genre
   
2. **Visual Previews**: Show sample terrain/entity sprites for each genre
   - Could use procedural sprite generation
   - Display small preview window next to genre description
   
3. **Genre Icons**: Custom icons representing each genre
   - Fantasy: Castle/sword icon
   - Sci-Fi: Spaceship/laser icon
   - Horror: Skull/moon icon
   - Cyberpunk: Circuit/neon icon
   - Post-Apoc: Radiation/wasteland icon
   
4. **Custom Genre Creation**: Player-defined genre parameters
   - Sliders for various thematic elements
   - Color palette customization
   - Entity name prefix/suffix selection
   
5. **Genre Descriptions**: Expanded info panel
   - Example enemy names
   - Equipment types list
   - Visual style description
   - Difficulty rating

6. **Remember Last Selection**: Store preference in settings
   - Default to last-played genre
   - Implement in `pkg/engine/settings.go`

## Known Limitations

- **No Genre Preview**: Players can't see visual samples before selecting
- **No Genre Mixing**: Single genre only (blending system exists but not exposed in UI)
- **Fixed Genre List**: Cannot add custom genres without code changes
- **No Genre Description Expansion**: Descriptions are single-line only

These limitations are acceptable for Phase 1.1 and can be addressed in future updates.

## Lessons Learned

1. **State Machine Validation**: Initially forgot to update `isValidAppTransition()`, causing state transition failures. Comprehensive state machine validation is critical.

2. **Layout Calculations**: Test coordinates must exactly match UI layout calculations. Off-by-one errors in Y positions caused initial test failures.

3. **Callback Wiring**: Game integration requires careful callback setup. Missing `SetGenreSelectCallback()` would break selection flow.

4. **Genre Storage Pattern**: One-time retrieval with clearing (`GetSelectedGenreID()`) prevents genre from being reused incorrectly across multiple game sessions.

5. **Test Coverage Importance**: Comprehensive test suite caught two major issues:
   - Incorrect position detection coordinates
   - Missing state transition rules
