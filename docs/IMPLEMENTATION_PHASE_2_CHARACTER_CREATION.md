## User Flow

```
Main Menu
    ↓ [Select Single-Player OR Multi-Player]
Character Creation - Step 1: Name Input
    ↓ [Enter name, press ENTER | Press F2 to save as default]
Character Creation - Step 2: Class Selection
    ↓ [Choose Warrior/Mage/Rogue, press ENTER | Press F2 to save as default]
Character Creation - Step 3: Portrait Selection (Optional)
    ↓ [Enter path to .png file OR press TAB to skip | Press F2 to save as default]
Character Creation - Step 4: Confirmation
    ↓ [Review character with portrait preview, press ENTER to confirm]
Single-Player: Start Gameplay with class-specific stats
Multi-Player: Connect to Server with character data
```

### Custom Defaults Feature

Players can save their preferred name and class as defaults using the **F2 key**:

- **Step 1 (Name Input)**: Press F2 to save the current name as default
- **Step 2 (Class Selection)**: Press F2 to save the current class as default
- **Step 3 (Portrait Selection)**: Press F2 to save the current portrait path as default *(NEW)*
- **Reset Behavior**: When character creation is reset (e.g., new game), defaults are automatically applied
- **Visual Feedback**: Current default values are displayed in gray text on each screen
- **Testing Benefits**: Saves time during development and repeated testing

**Example Workflow**:
1. Enter preferred name (e.g., "Hero"), press F2 → "Default name saved!"
2. Select preferred class (e.g., Warrior), press F2 → "Default class saved!"
3. Enter portrait path (e.g., "/home/user/avatar.png"), press F2 → "Default portrait path saved!" *(NEW)*
4. On subsequent character creations, name, class, and portrait are pre-filled

**Implementation**:
- `CharacterCreationDefaults` struct stores default name, class, and portrait path
- `SetDefaults()` and `GetDefaults()` methods provide external configuration
- `Reset()` method applies defaults when resetting character creation
- F2 key handlers in name input, class selection, and portrait selection screens

### Custom Portrait Feature *(NEW)*

Players can customize their character's appearance with a local `.png` image:

- **File Requirements**: PNG format only, maximum 512x512 pixels
- **Auto-Downscaling**: Images larger than 512x512 are automatically downscaled using bilinear interpolation while preserving aspect ratio
- **Optional**: Press TAB or leave empty to skip portrait selection
- **Multiplayer Support**: Portrait images are user-provided from local device, not considered "static game assets"
- **Visual Preview**: Portrait is displayed during confirmation step and in final character summary

**Technical Implementation**:
- `LoadPortrait(path string)` function validates file extension, loads PNG, and downscales if needed
- Uses `golang.org/x/image/draw` package for high-quality bilinear scaling
- Portrait stored as `*ebiten.Image` in `CharacterData.Portrait` field
- Portrait path stored in `CharacterData.PortraitPath` for persistence/networking
- Validation order: extension check → file exists check → PNG decode → downscaling

**Benefits**:
- **Personalization**: Players can use their own artwork or photos
- **Multiplayer Identity**: Other players see custom portraits for easy identification
- **No Asset Pipeline**: No need to integrate portraits into game build process
- **Future-Ready**: Portrait data can be synced to server via base64 encoding or hash caching

### Controls

**Name Input (Step 1)**:
- Type: Alphanumeric characters and spaces
- Backspace: Delete last character
- Enter: Proceed to class selection
- Validation: 1-20 characters, non-empty

**Class Selection (Step 2)**:
- Arrow Up/Down: Navigate classes
- 1/2/3: Direct class selection
- Enter: Confirm and proceed
- Backspace/ESC: Return to name input

**Confirmation (Step 3)**:
- Enter/Space: Begin adventure
- Backspace/ESC: Return to class selection

## Technical Architecture

### State Machine Integration

Character creation integrates with the existing AppState system for both single-player and multiplayer:

```
AppStateMainMenu 
    ↓ [Single-Player]
AppStateCharacterCreation (isMultiplayerMode = false)
    ↓
AppStateGameplay → onNewGame() callback

AppStateMainMenu
    ↓ [Multi-Player]
AppStateCharacterCreation (isMultiplayerMode = true)
    ↓
AppStateGameplay → onMultiplayerConnect() callback
```

The AppStateCharacterCreation state is already defined in `pkg/engine/app_state.go` and was waiting for implementation.

### Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Player enters name and selects class in UI
2. **Mode Selection**: isMultiplayerMode flag set based on menu choice
3. **Validation**: CharacterData.Validate() checks name length and class validity
4. **Pending Storage**: Data stored in game.pendingCharData during transition
5. **Callback Routing**: 
   - Single-player: onNewGame() → world generation → player entity creation
   - Multiplayer: onMultiplayerConnect() → server connection → player entity creation
6. **Stat Application**: After player entity creation, ApplyClassStats() modifies components:
   - HealthComponent (Current, Max)
   - ManaComponent (Current, Max, Regen)
   - StatsComponent (Attack, Defense, CritChance, CritDamage, Evasion)
   - AttackComponent (Damage, Cooldown)
7. **Cleanup**: pendingCharData cleared after application

### Multiplayer Readiness

The CharacterData struct is designed for network synchronization:
- Simple value types (string, enum)
- Validation ensures data integrity
- No Ebiten-specific types
- Ready for protocol buffer or JSON encoding

**Current Implementation**: Character creation happens on both client and server connection flows. When a player selects "Multi-Player" from the main menu, they create their character before connecting to the server. The character data is available via `GetPendingCharacterData()` when the connection is established.

**Future Enhancement**: 
- Add network protocol message type for character data sync
- Server validates character data on connection
- Server broadcasts character info to other players
- Add NameComponent for displaying player names in multiplayer

## Testing Strategy

    world := NewWorld()
    player := world.CreateEntity()
    
    player.AddComponent(&HealthComponent{Current: 100, Max: 100})
    player.AddComponent(&ManaComponent{Current: 100, Max: 100, Regen: 5.0})
    player.AddComponent(NewStatsComponent())
    player.AddComponent(&AttackComponent{Damage: 15, Range: 50, Cooldown: 0.5})
    
    err := ApplyClassStats(player, ClassWarrior)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("ApplyClassStats() error = %v", err)
    }
    
    // Verify warrior stats
    healthComp, _ := player.GetComponent("health")
    health := healthComp.(*HealthComponent)
    if health.Max != 150 {
        t.Errorf("Warrior health = %v, want 150", health.Max)
    }
    // ... more assertions
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2.1 (Future)

1. **Appearance Customization**
   - Hair color selection
   - Skin tone selection
   - Sprite generation based on choices

2. **Stat Allocation**
   - Starting stat points (e.g., 10 points)
   - Player distributes between Health, Mana, Attack, Defense
   - Prevents min-maxing with reasonable limits

3. **Name Component**
   - Add NameComponent to player entity
   - Display in HUD for multiplayer identification
   - Use in chat system

4. **Save/Load Integration**
   - Store character data in save files
   - Load character on "Load Game"
   - Display character info in save file list

5. **Multiplayer Synchronization**
   - Network message for character data
   - Server validates character data
   - Other players see character name/class

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: AppStateCharacterCreation was already defined, making integration seamless
2. **Component System**: ApplyClassStats() cleanly modifies existing components
3. **Testing**: Table-driven tests provided excellent coverage with minimal code
4. **SIMPLICITY RULE**: Three-step UI is intuitive without overwhelming new players

### Design Decisions

1. **Why Three Steps?**: Each step has a single focus (name, class, confirm), reducing cognitive load
2. **Why Keyboard Only?**: Mobile support planned separately, keyboard navigation is simpler
3. **Why No Visual Customization?**: Deferred to Phase 2.1 to ship MVP faster
4. **Why Embedded Tutorial?**: Class descriptions teach core mechanics naturally

### Performance Considerations

- UI rendering: <1ms per frame (simple vector drawing)
- State transitions: <1ms (simple enum comparisons)
- Stat application: <1ms (direct component modification)
- No performance impact on gameplay
