# Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for Venture, a fully procedural multiplayer action-RPG built with Go 1.24 and Ebiten 2.9. The project successfully completed its initial 8 development phases (Foundation through Polish & Optimization) in October 2025. This roadmap presents the post-Beta enhancement strategy based on comprehensive technical audits and community feedback priorities.

## Project Status: BETA TO PRODUCTION TRANSITION ðŸš€

**Current Phase:** Post-Beta Enhancement (Phase 9)  
**Version:** 1.0 Beta â†’ 1.1 Production  
**Timeline Horizon:** 6-8 months (January - August 2026)  
**Status:** Active Development - Production Hardening

### Current State Strengths âœ…

- **Mature Architecture**: Clean ECS design with 48.9% engine coverage, 100% combat/procgen coverage
- **Deterministic Generation**: Fully seed-based with multiplayer synchronization proven at 200-5000ms latency
- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop (Linux/macOS/Windows), WebAssembly, mobile (iOS/Android) all operational
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 82.4% average test coverage, table-driven tests throughout
- **Production Monitoring**: Structured logging with logrus integrated across all major packages
- **Visual Fidelity**: Phase 5 sprite system complete with silhouette analysis, cache optimization (65-75% hit rate)
- **Performance**: 106 FPS achieved with 2000 entities (exceeds 60 FPS target)

### Technical Debt Priorities ðŸ”§

1. **Test Coverage Gaps**: engine (48.9%), rendering/sprites (50.0%), rendering/patterns (0.0%), saveload (66.9%), network (57.1%)
2. **Death/Revival Mechanics**: Incomplete implementation - player death doesn't disable actions or drop items
3. **Menu UX Consistency**: Not all menus support dual-exit (toggle key + ESC)
4. **Performance Profiling**: Visual sluggishness reported despite 106 FPS metric (frame time variance likely)
5. **LAN Party Experience**: No single-command "host-and-play" mode for local co-op

### Active Development Focus (January 2026) ðŸŽ¯

Per `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, currently completing **GAP-001 through GAP-003** (Spell System):
- âœ… Elemental status effects (Fire/Ice/Lightning/Poison DoT)
- âœ… Shield absorption mechanics
- âœ… Buff/debuff stat modification system
- Coverage improvement: 45.7% â†’ 46.4% (engine package)

**Next milestone:** Complete remaining high-priority gaps (GAP-007, GAP-009, GAP-015), then proceed to Phase 9 enhancements.

## Enhancement Categories

Based on comprehensive analysis of `docs/auditors/` and codebase audit, enhancements are organized into 6 categories prioritized by impact, effort, and risk.

---

### Category 1: Core Gameplay Mechanics (MUST HAVE)

**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: Large (3-4 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: None - foundational work

These enhancements address game-breaking gaps and incomplete mechanics identified in `docs/auditors/AUTO_AUDIT.md` and `docs/auditors/EVENT.md`.

#### 1.1: Complete Death & Revival System

**Description**: Implement comprehensive death mechanics including entity immobilization, action disabling, item dropping, and multiplayer revival system.

**Rationale**: Currently referenced in `docs/auditors/EVENT.md:L15-L34` as critical gap. Player death doesn't properly disable actions, items don't drop, and revival mechanics are non-functional. This creates confusing gameplay states and breaks multiplayer cooperation expectations.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Add `DeadComponent` to `pkg/engine/combat_components.go` with `timeOfDeath` field
2. Modify `CombatSystem.Update()` in `pkg/engine/combat_system.go:L123-L187` to check health and apply `DeadComponent`
3. Gate all action systems (movement, attack, spell casting, item use) on absence of `DeadComponent`
4. Implement item drop spawning in death handler: create entity with `PositionComponent`, `SpriteComponent`, and `PickupComponent`
5. Add proximity detection in multiplayer: check for nearby ally entities (distance < 32 units)
6. On revival: remove `DeadComponent`, restore 20% health, trigger resurrection animation

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero-health entities cannot move, attack, cast spells, or use items
- Items from inventory spawn at death location within 64-unit radius
- In multiplayer, ally touch triggers revival restoring 20% max health
- Death and revival properly synchronized across clients via network protocol
- Comprehensive test suite covering single-player death, multiplayer revival, edge cases (simultaneous deaths)

**Risks**:
- Network desync if death/revival not properly synchronized (mitigate with authoritative server approach)
- Item drop physics causing items to spawn inside walls (mitigate with collision validation)
- Revival griefing potential (mitigate with cooldown or animation lock)

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/engine/combat_system.go` (death detection logic)
- `pkg/engine/combat_components.go` (new DeadComponent)
- `pkg/engine/movement_system.go` (gate on !hasDeadComponent)
- `pkg/engine/spell_casting.go` (gate on !hasDeadComponent)
- `pkg/network/protocol.go` (add death/revival message types)

---

#### 1.2: Menu Navigation Standardization

**Description**: Enforce consistent dual-exit navigation (toggle key + ESC) across all in-game menus as specified in `docs/auditors/MENUS.md`.

**Rationale**: Referenced in `docs/auditors/MENUS.md:L1-L40`. Current implementation has "menu traps" where only specific exit methods work. Inconsistent UX reduces polish and frustrates players accustomed to standard escape patterns.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Audit all menu handlers in `cmd/client/main.go:L600-L1360` (inventory, character, skills, quests, map, settings)
2. Create `MenuState` abstraction in `pkg/engine/menu_system.go` with `openKey`, `isOpen`, `Toggle()`, `Close()` methods
3. Modify input handling to check for both `ebiten.Key{openKey}` and `ebiten.KeyEscape` on every frame
4. Ensure `game.menuOpen` state properly tracks active menu for mutual exclusion
5. Add visual indicators: "[I] Inventory - Press I or ESC to close" in menu headers
6. Implement menu stack for nested menus (e.g., settings submenu)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 8 menus (Inventory, Character, Skills, Quests, Map, Settings, Help, Debug) support both toggle key and ESC
- No menu can become "trapped" requiring specific exit action
- Menu toggle keys documented in central constants file (`pkg/engine/menu_keys.go`)
- Visual indicators present in all menu headers
- Test cases verify both exit methods from all game states (combat, exploration, pause)

**Risks**:
- Key conflict with existing bindings (mitigate with conflict detection system)
- Nested menu confusion (mitigate with breadcrumb navigation)

**Reference Files**:
- `cmd/client/main.go:L1000-L1100` (input handling)
- `pkg/engine/ui_system.go` (menu rendering)
- New file: `pkg/engine/menu_system.go` (abstraction layer)

---

#### 1.3: Commerce & NPC Interaction System

**Description**: Implement shop mechanics with fixed and nomadic merchants, dialog interface, and transaction system as outlined in `docs/auditors/EXPAND.md:L23-L42`.

**Rationale**: Provides gameplay depth, economic loops, and NPC interaction missing from current implementation. Essential for long-term engagement and resource management strategy.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Create `MerchantComponent` in `pkg/engine/commerce_components.go` with `inventory`, `priceMultiplier`, `merchantType` (fixed/nomadic)
2. Add `DialogComponent` with `currentDialog`, `availableOptions []DialogOption`, `state` fields
3. Implement `DialogSystem` in `pkg/engine/dialog_system.go` using interface `DialogProvider` for extensibility
4. Generate merchant inventory using existing `item.Generator` with genre-appropriate stock
5. Add shop UI in `pkg/rendering/ui/shop.go` showing merchant inventory grid and player gold
6. Implement transaction logic: validate gold, transfer items, apply price calculations
7. Spawn nomadic merchants deterministically: use world seed + time cycle to place in random rooms

**Success Criteria**:
- Fixed shopkeepers spawn in town areas (terrain type = settlement)
- Nomadic merchants spawn every 10 minutes at deterministic locations
- Dialog system supports simple text-based interaction with "Buy", "Sell", "Leave" options
- Transactions validate gold availability and inventory space
- Prices scale with item rarity: Common 1.0x, Uncommon 1.5x, Rare 3.0x, Epic 8.0x, Legendary 25.0x
- Interface designed for future extensions (branching dialogs, voice, animations)
- Multiplayer synchronization ensures only one player can transact at a time

**Risks**:
- Economic balance issues (mitigate with configurable price multipliers and testing)
- Merchant spawn determinism breaking in multiplayer (mitigate with server-authoritative spawn logic)

**Reference Files**:
- New files: `pkg/engine/commerce_components.go`, `pkg/engine/dialog_system.go`, `pkg/rendering/ui/shop.go`
- `pkg/procgen/entity/generator.go:L200-L250` (NPC generation)
- `pkg/procgen/terrain/generator.go:L150-L200` (settlement detection)

---

### Category 2: User Experience & Polish (SHOULD HAVE)

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Category 1 completion for consistent base

#### 2.1: LAN Party "Host-and-Play" Mode

**Description**: Single-command mode that starts authoritative server and auto-connects local client, as specified in `docs/auditors/LAN_PARTY.md`.

**Rationale**: Current workflow requires two terminals and manual connection steps. Ideal LAN party/casual co-op experience should be "player 1 runs one command, shares IP, others join". Reduces barrier to entry for multiplayer.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Add `--host-and-play` flag to `cmd/client/main.go`
2. When flag set, start `server.Run()` in goroutine before game initialization
3. Bind server to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default (security: localhost only)
4. Add `--host-lan` flag to override bind address to `0.0.0.0` with warning
5. Wait for server readiness via channel: `serverReady := make(chan struct{})`
6. Auto-set `-server localhost:8080` flag and enable `-multiplayer`
7. Implement graceful shutdown: defer `server.Shutdown()` and wait for goroutine completion
8. Add port conflict handling: try ports 8080-8089, fail with clear error if all in use

**Success Criteria**:
- Single command `./venture-client --host-and-play` starts server and connects client
- Default bind to localhost (secure) with explicit `--host-lan` for 0.0.0.0
- Server logs clearly indicate "Server ready on localhost:8080"
- Graceful shutdown on client exit: server goroutine terminates cleanly
- Documentation in README.md shows LAN party workflow: host runs command, shares IP, others join
- Integration test verifies server start, client connection, and clean shutdown

**Risks**:
- Port conflicts on shared machines (mitigated by auto-fallback)
- Firewall blocking LAN connections (document firewall rules)
- Resource cleanup issues (mitigated by defer pattern and channel synchronization)

**Reference Files**:
- `cmd/client/main.go:L220-L280` (initialization)
- `cmd/server/main.go:L100-L150` (server startup)
- New file: `pkg/engine/host_and_play.go` (goroutine management)

---

#### 2.2: Character Creation & Tutorial Integration

**Description**: Transform existing tutorial into unified character creation onboarding flow as outlined in `docs/auditors/EXPAND.md:L9-L21`.

**Rationale**: Current tutorial system (`pkg/engine/tutorial.go`) is separate from game start. Modern RPGs integrate character creation with tutorial for seamless onboarding. Improves first-time user experience and reduces player drop-off.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Create `CharacterCreationState` game state in `pkg/engine/game_states.go`
2. Modify main menu to show "New Game" â†’ CharacterCreationState transition
3. Design creation flow: Name input â†’ Class selection (Warrior/Mage/Rogue) â†’ Confirm
4. During creation, show tutorial prompts: "Warriors excel at melee combat", "Use WASD to move"
5. Generate starting stats based on class: Warrior (high HP, low mana), Mage (low HP, high mana), Rogue (balanced)
6. Transition to gameplay after creation with tutorial quest auto-added
7. Ensure creation works in both single-player and multiplayer (sync character data to server)

**Success Criteria**:
- New game flow: Main menu â†’ Character creation â†’ Gameplay (no interruption)
- Tutorial information integrated naturally into creation steps
- Class selection affects starting stats and equipment
- Character data persists through save/load system
- Multiplayer: character creation happens client-side, synced to server on connection
- Extensible for future customization: appearance, stat allocation, ability selection

**Risks**:
- Complexity increase for new players (mitigate with clear step-by-step UI)
- Save/load compatibility with existing saves (mitigate with optional character data in save format)

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/engine/tutorial.go:L1-L100` (existing tutorial system)
- `cmd/client/main.go:L190-L250` (player entity creation)
- New file: `pkg/engine/character_creation.go`

---

#### 2.3: Main Menu & Game Modes System

**Description**: Implement splash screen menu system with Single-Player/Multi-Player selection and sub-menus as described in `docs/auditors/EXPAND.md:L1-L7`.

**Rationale**: Current implementation starts directly into gameplay with CLI flags. Professional games need proper main menu with save management, server connection UI, and settings before gameplay starts.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Create `MainMenuState` in `pkg/engine/game_states.go` as initial game state
2. Render menu using `pkg/rendering/ui/menu.go` with vertical option list
3. Main menu options: "Single-Player", "Multi-Player", "Settings", "Quit"
4. Single-Player submenu: "New Game" (â†’ CharacterCreation), "Load Game" (â†’ save file picker), "Back"
5. Multi-Player submenu: Text field for server address, "Connect" button, "Back"
6. Store menu state in `game.currentState` and route `Update()`/`Draw()` calls
7. Implement smooth transitions: fade out â†’ state change â†’ fade in

**Success Criteria**:
- Game launches to main menu, not directly into gameplay
- All menu options functional and lead to correct states
- Server address field supports standard input (keyboard entry, paste)
- Settings menu persists between sessions (stored in config file)
- Visual polish: title logo (procedurally generated), genre-themed background
- Responsive controls: mouse and keyboard navigation

**Risks**:
- Increased startup time perception (mitigate with quick initial load and background generation)
- UI complexity (mitigate with simple, clean design and consistent navigation)

**Reference Files**:
- New file: `pkg/engine/game_states.go` (state machine)
- New file: `pkg/rendering/ui/main_menu.go`
- `cmd/client/main.go:L1-L50` (CLI flag handling â†’ migrate to menu)

---

#### 2.4: Dynamic Music Context Switching

**Description**: Implement adaptive music system that changes background music based on game context (exploration, combat, boss fight, victory).

**Rationale**: Identified in system integration audit (`docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` Issue #5). AudioManager currently only plays exploration music without context awareness. Dynamic music significantly enhances player immersion and emotional engagement.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Context Detection** (2 days):
   - Add music context enum: Exploration, Combat, Boss, Victory, Death
   - Implement context detection in AudioManagerSystem.Update():
     - Check for nearby enemies within 300-unit radius (Combat)
     - Check for boss entities with proximity (Boss)
     - Check player health < 20% (Danger variant)
     - Default to Exploration when no enemies nearby

2. **Music Transition System** (2 days):
   - Implement crossfade between tracks: fade out current over 2 seconds, fade in new
   - Add transition cooldown: prevent rapid switching (minimum 10 seconds in context)
   - Cache generated music tracks to avoid regeneration overhead
   - Priority system: Boss > Combat > Danger > Exploration

3. **Music Generation** (2 days):
   - Extend `pkg/audio/music` to generate context-appropriate compositions:
     - Exploration: slow tempo (80 BPM), major keys, ambient
     - Combat: fast tempo (140 BPM), minor keys, percussion emphasis
     - Boss: intense tempo (160 BPM), dramatic orchestration, bass drops
     - Victory: triumphant (120 BPM), major keys, fanfare elements
   - Use genre-specific instruments per context

4. **Integration & Testing** (1 day):
   - Test transitions in various scenarios: entering combat, boss encounters
   - Verify smooth crossfades without audio pops or clicks
   - Add configuration: `-music-dynamic` flag to enable/disable

**Success Criteria**:
- Music changes appropriately when entering/leaving combat
- Boss music triggers for boss entities and persists until defeat
- Smooth transitions with no audio artifacts
- Context persists for minimum duration (no rapid switching)
- Genre-appropriate instrumentation maintained across contexts

**Effort**: Small (7 days)  
**Priority**: Medium (UX enhancement)  
**Risk**: Low - audio system already functional, adding context detection

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/engine/audio_manager.go:186` (AudioManagerSystem)
- `pkg/audio/music/generator.go` (music generation)
- `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (Issue #5: Music Context Not Dynamic)

---

### Category 3: Gameplay Depth Expansion (COULD HAVE)

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Large (4-5 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Category 1 and 2 for stable foundation

#### 3.1: Environmental Manipulation System

**Description**: Destructible and constructible terrain with fire propagation as outlined in `docs/auditors/EXPAND.md:L44-L65`.

**Rationale**: Adds strategic depth and emergent gameplay. Players can create shortcuts, block enemy paths, or suffer consequences of fire spells. Aligns with immersive sim design philosophy.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Add `Destructible` flag to `TileComponent` in `pkg/engine/terrain_components.go`
2. Implement `TerrainModificationSystem` in `pkg/engine/terrain_system.go`
3. Weapon-based destruction: check weapon type (pickaxe, bombs) and apply to adjacent tiles on attack
4. Spell-based destruction: fire/explosion spells check area of effect and destroy vulnerable tiles
5. Fire propagation: add `FireComponent` to tiles with `intensity`, `duration`, `spreadChance` fields
6. Fire system: each tick, check 4-connected neighbors, spread based on chance and tile material
7. Construction: add `BuildComponent` with required materials (stone, wood from inventory)
8. Networked sync: send tile modification messages to server, broadcast to all clients
9. Save/load: serialize modified tiles with world state

**Success Criteria**:
- Pickaxe weapons can destroy wall tiles (2-3 hits depending on material)
- Fire/explosion spells destroy tiles in 3Ã—3 area
- Fire spreads to adjacent wooden/flammable tiles at 30% chance per second
- Fire burns for 10-15 seconds before extinguishing
- Players can build walls from inventory materials (10 stone per tile)
- Multiplayer: all clients see same terrain modifications deterministically
- Performance: <5ms per frame for fire propagation with 100 burning tiles

**Risks**:
- Performance impact with many simultaneous fires (mitigate with spatial culling and maximum fire entity limit)
- Map becoming unsolvable (mitigate by marking critical paths as indestructible)
- Network bandwidth for frequent modifications (mitigate with delta compression and batching)

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/procgen/terrain/generator.go:L100-L200` (tile generation)
- `pkg/engine/combat_system.go:L200-L250` (damage application)
- New file: `pkg/engine/terrain_system.go`

---

#### 3.2: Crafting System (Potions, Enchanting, Magic Items)

**Description**: Comprehensive crafting mechanics for consumables, equipment enhancement, and magic item creation as described in `docs/auditors/EXPAND.md:L67-L88`.

**Rationale**: Provides long-term progression, resource management, and player agency. Integrates with existing item generation system to create hybrid player-crafted/procedurally-enhanced items.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Create `CraftingSystem` in `pkg/engine/crafting_system.go` with recipe management
2. Define `Recipe` struct: `inputs []ItemRequirement`, `output ItemTemplate`, `skillRequired`, `successChance`
3. Implement recipe discovery: found in world, unlocked via skill progression, learned from NPCs
4. Potion brewing: combine herbs (consumable items) + flask â†’ healing/mana/buff potions
5. Enchanting: weapon/armor + enchantment scroll + gold â†’ add stat bonuses or effects
6. Magic item crafting: base item + magic essence + crafting materials â†’ wands/rings/amulets
7. Add crafting UI in `pkg/rendering/ui/crafting.go` showing available recipes and material availability
8. Integrate with skill system: crafting skill level affects success chance and available recipes
9. Deterministic results: use player seed + recipe ID + material seeds for output generation

**Success Criteria**:
- 15+ base recipes across 3 crafting types (potions, enchanting, magic items)
- Recipes discovered through gameplay (world drops, quest rewards, NPC teaching)
- Crafting success chance based on skill level (50% at level 1, 95% at max)
- Failed crafting consumes 50% of materials (player risk/reward decision)
- Crafted items retain procedural generation aesthetic while showing player customization
- Multiplayer: crafting synchronized, recipe knowledge shared in party

**Risks**:
- Economic balance disruption (mitigate with high material costs and failure chance)
- Complexity overwhelming players (mitigate with tutorial quest and gradual recipe introduction)
- Determinism issues with multiplayer crafting (mitigate with server-authoritative results)

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/procgen/item/generator.go:L150-L300` (item generation)
- `pkg/engine/inventory_system.go:L100-L200` (inventory management)
- New file: `pkg/engine/crafting_system.go`
- New file: `pkg/rendering/ui/crafting.go`

### Category 4: Performance & Optimization (SHOULD HAVE)

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Profiling must happen early to inform all other work

#### 4.1: Visual Performance Optimization

**Description**: Eliminate reported sluggishness through comprehensive profiling and optimization as detailed in `docs/auditors/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`.

**Rationale**: Despite 106 FPS average, players report visible lag. Likely culprit is frame time variance (jank) causing perceived stutter. Profiling required to identify actual bottlenecks rather than premature optimization.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Assessment Phase** (3 days):
   - CPU profiling: `go test -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -bench=. ./pkg/...`
   - Memory profiling: `go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=. ./pkg/...`
   - Frame time tracking: add `FrameTimeTracker` to measure 1%, 0.1% lows
   - Network profiling: log packet sizes and timing in multiplayer

2. **Critical Path Optimization** (4 days):
   - Sprite batch rendering: group draws by texture atlas (reduce draw calls)
   - Entity query caching: cache `GetEntitiesWithComponents()` results until invalidation
   - Collision detection: optimize quadtree (tune cell size, implement lazy updates)
   - Component access: add fast-path type assertions in hot loops

3. **Memory Allocation Reduction** (3 days):
   - Audit allocations in `Update()` loops across all systems
   - Implement object pooling for `StatusEffectComponent`, `ParticleComponent`
   - Reuse slice buffers for entity queries: `entityBuffer []Entity` as system field
   - Profile-guided optimization: focus on top 5 allocation sites

4. **Validation** (2 days):
   - Before/after frame time distribution graphs
   - Performance regression test suite: benchmark all systems
   - 60 FPS validation with 5000 entities (2.5x stress test)

**Success Criteria**:
- 1% low frame time â‰¥ 16.67ms (no perceptible stutter)
- 0.1% low frame time â‰¥ 10ms (rare frames OK, no hard drops)
- Allocation rate < 10MB/s during typical gameplay
- Draw calls < 100 per frame (batch rendering effective)
- Frame time variance (std dev) < 2ms
- All optimizations verified with benchmarks showing â‰¥ 20% improvement

**Risks**:
- Premature optimization reducing code clarity (mitigate with profiling-first approach)
- Platform-specific issues (mitigate with testing on Linux/macOS/Windows)

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/rendering/sprites/generator.go:L200-L300` (sprite generation)
- `pkg/engine/ecs.go:L50-L100` (entity queries)
- `pkg/engine/collision_system.go:L100-L200` (quadtree)
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` (existing performance guide)

---

#### 4.2: Test Coverage Improvement

**Description**: Increase test coverage in packages below 70% to meet project standard: engine (48.9%), rendering/sprites (50.0%), rendering/patterns (0.0%), saveload (66.9%), network (57.1%).

**Rationale**: Current coverage gaps identified in test run output. Low coverage in critical systems (engine, network) increases risk of regressions and production bugs. Project standard is 65%+ per package, 80%+ for critical paths.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Coverage Analysis** (1 day):
   - Run `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./pkg/...`
   - Generate HTML: `go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html`
   - Identify uncovered critical paths using coverage annotations

2. **Engine Package** (3 days, target 70%):
   - Focus on untested systems: `AnimationSystem`, `ParticleSystem`, `MenuSystem`
   - Add integration tests for system interactions (combat + status effects)
   - Mock Ebiten dependencies for CI-friendly tests

3. **Rendering Packages** (3 days, target 75%):
   - `rendering/sprites`: test cache miss paths, edge cases in generation
   - `rendering/patterns`: implement first tests (currently 0%), focus on pattern generation algorithms
   - Use interface-based mocks for `ebiten.Image` operations

4. **Network Package** (2 days, target 70%):
   - Add tests for error conditions: connection drops, malformed packets
   - Integration tests for prediction and reconciliation
   - Mock network I/O for deterministic testing

5. **Saveload Package** (1 day, target 75%):
   - Test edge cases: corrupted saves, missing files, version mismatches
   - Test equipment and fog-of-war persistence (currently missing per GAP-015)

**Success Criteria**:
- All packages â‰¥ 65% coverage
- Critical packages (engine, network, saveload) â‰¥ 70%
- No untestable code (0% coverage) except Ebiten-dependent rendering (pixel operations)
- New tests follow table-driven pattern matching project convention
- CI pipeline runs all tests with `-tags test` flag successfully

**Risks**:
- Time investment with limited user-facing benefit (mitigate by prioritizing critical paths)
- Mock complexity for Ebiten dependencies (mitigate with thin interface wrappers)

**Reference Files**:
- All `pkg/` directories with `*_test.go` files
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` (CI configuration)

---

#### 4.3: Spatial Partition System Integration

**Description**: Integrate SpatialPartitionSystem from perftest into main game client for improved entity query performance with large entity counts.

**Rationale**: Identified in system integration audit (`docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md`). SpatialPartitionSystem currently only used in `cmd/perftest` but could provide viewport culling optimization for main game when entity counts exceed 500. Performance tests show benefits with 2000+ entities.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Integration Phase** (2 days):
   - Add SpatialPartitionSystem instantiation in `cmd/client/main.go` after world creation
   - Set world bounds based on terrain dimensions: `NewSpatialPartitionSystem(terrainWidth*32, terrainHeight*32)`
   - Connect to RenderSystem via existing `SetSpatialPartition()` method
   - Register in ECS World with `world.AddSystem(spatialSystem)`

2. **Configuration** (1 day):
   - Add config flag: `-enable-spatial-partition` for opt-in testing
   - Tune cell size parameter (default 64 units, test 32/128 for different map sizes)
   - Add performance metrics: track culled entities vs. rendered

3. **Validation** (1 day):
   - Benchmark with 500, 1000, 2000 entity scenarios
   - Verify viewport culling works correctly (entities outside view not rendered)
   - Ensure no visual glitches (entities popping in/out at viewport edge)

**Success Criteria**:
- Performance improvement: â‰¥10% frame time reduction with 500+ entities
- No visual artifacts or entity popping
- Graceful degradation if disabled (fallback to render all entities)
- Integration documented in system audit update

**Effort**: Small (4 days)  
**Priority**: Low (optional optimization)  
**Risk**: Low - existing system with proven implementation in perftest

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/engine/spatial_partition.go:218` (SpatialPartitionSystem definition)
- `pkg/engine/render_system.go:183` (SetSpatialPartition method)
- `cmd/perftest/main.go:43` (current usage example)
- `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (Issue #4)

---

### Category 5: Visual Fidelity Enhancement (COULD HAVE)

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (3-4 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Performance optimization (Category 4) to ensure budget for visual improvements

#### 5.1: Advanced Anatomical Sprite Generation

**Description**: Enhance sprite recognizability with improved anatomical accuracy as detailed in `docs/auditors/VISUAL.md` and `VISUAL_FIDELITY_SUMMARY.md`.

**Rationale**: While Phase 5 established foundation (silhouette analysis, cache, outlines), sprites still lack fine anatomical detail. Current 28Ã—28 pixel constraint limits clarity. Goal is "good enough" visual recognition, not photorealism.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Enhanced Body Part Templates** (1 week):
   - Refine humanoid templates in `pkg/rendering/sprites/templates.go`
   - Add sub-pixel rendering hints: anti-aliasing for diagonal edges
   - Implement proportional scaling: head = 4Ã—4 pixels, torso = 4Ã—6, legs = 4Ã—8
   - Add facial feature generation: eyes (2 pixels), mouth (1-2 pixels) for close-up views

2. **Layered Composition Enhancement** (1 week):
   - Improve `pkg/rendering/sprites/composition.go` with blend modes
   - Add shadow layer: 50% opacity, 1-pixel offset for depth perception
   - Implement highlight layer: 25% opacity, top-edge for lighting effect
   - Clothing over skin: proper alpha blending and color tinting

3. **Genre-Specific Anatomy Variations** (1 week):
   - Fantasy: organic proportions, flowing robes, medieval armor plates
   - Sci-Fi: geometric augments, angular armor, cybernetic limbs
   - Horror: elongated/distorted proportions, visible bone/decay
   - Refine genre palettes for anatomical emphasis

4. **Silhouette Refinement** (1 week):
   - Improve silhouette scoring algorithm to penalize ambiguous shapes
   - Implement iterative refinement: regenerate sprites scoring < 0.6
   - Add A/B testing framework: compare old vs. new sprite generations

**Success Criteria**:
- Silhouette scores increase by average of 0.1 (e.g., 0.65 â†’ 0.75)
- Player survey: 80%+ can identify entity type at a glance (warrior vs. mage vs. rogue)
- No performance regression: sprite generation still < 5ms per sprite (cached)
- Maintain 28Ã—28 pixel constraint for player characters
- Enemy sprites can scale up to 64Ã—64 for bosses with proportional detail increase

**Risks**:
- Diminishing returns on 28Ã—28 canvas (mitigate with selective detail and color coding)
- Generation complexity increase (mitigate with caching and lazy evaluation)

#### 5.2: Equipment Visual System

**Description**: Implement visual representation of equipped items on character sprites, showing weapons, armor, and accessories dynamically.

**Rationale**: Identified in system integration audit (`docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md`). EquipmentVisualSystem is defined but never integrated. Players expect to see equipped gear on their character for visual feedback and immersion.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **System Integration** (2 days):
   - Instantiate EquipmentVisualSystem in `cmd/client/main.go` with sprite generator
   - Register with ECS World: `world.AddSystem(equipmentVisualSystem)`
   - Add EquipmentVisualComponent to player and NPC entities
   - Connect to EquipmentComponent for gear change detection

2. **Composite Sprite Generation** (3 days):
   - Implement `regenerateEquipmentLayers()` to create layered sprites
   - Generate equipment overlays: weapon sprites (8Ã—8), armor tints, accessories
   - Composite layers onto base character sprite using alpha blending
   - Cache composited results with invalidation on equipment change

3. **Equipment Sprite Templates** (2 days):
   - Create weapon sprite templates: swords, bows, staves, guns (genre-specific)
   - Create armor visual styles: color tints for light/medium/heavy armor
   - Create accessory indicators: glowing effects for magic items

4. **Performance Optimization** (1 day):
   - Regenerate only when equipment changes (dirty flag tracking)
   - Cache composite sprites (reuse until invalidation)
   - Limit regeneration frequency (max 1/second to prevent spam)

**Success Criteria**:
- Equipped weapons visible in character sprite (held in hand position)
- Armor affects character color/tint (e.g., plate armor = metallic shine)
- Accessories show visual indicators (e.g., magic ring = particle glow)
- No performance regression: composite generation < 10ms per character
- Equipment changes reflected within 1 frame

**Effort**: Medium (8 days)  
**Priority**: Medium (visual polish)  
**Risk**: Medium - sprite composition complexity may require iteration

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/engine/equipment_visual_system.go:14` (system definition)
- `pkg/rendering/sprites/composition.go` (composite sprite generation)
- `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (Issue #1: Orphaned Systems)

---

#### 5.3: Dynamic Lighting System

**Description**: Implement dynamic lighting with point lights, ambient light, and falloff for enhanced visual atmosphere.

**Rationale**: Identified in system integration audit (`docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md`). lighting.System is defined but not integrated. Dynamic lighting would significantly enhance visual fidelity and atmosphere, especially for horror and dungeon scenarios.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **System Integration** (2 days):
   - Integrate `pkg/rendering/lighting` system into game loop
   - Create LightingSystem wrapper for ECS integration
   - Add LightComponent to entities (torches, spells, player)

2. **Lighting Calculation** (3 days):
   - Implement per-pixel lighting in post-processing pass
   - Support point lights with radius and falloff (linear, quadratic, inverse-square)
   - Add ambient light configuration (adjustable per genre/area)
   - Apply gamma correction for realistic appearance

3. **Light Sources** (2 days):
   - Player torch: 200-unit radius point light (follows player)
   - Spell effects: colored lights (fire=orange, ice=blue, lightning=white)
   - Environmental lights: wall torches, magic crystals, bioluminescence
   - Dynamic lights: flickering torches, pulsing magic

4. **Performance Optimization** (2 days):
   - Light culling: only calculate lights within viewport
   - Light limit: max 16 active lights per frame (configurable)
   - Deferred lighting: calculate lighting in separate pass
   - Add performance toggle: `-enable-lighting` flag for opt-in

**Success Criteria**:
- Visible light/shadow contrast enhances atmosphere
- No performance regression: maintain 60 FPS with up to 16 lights
- Genre-appropriate lighting: horror uses low ambient, fantasy uses warm tones
- Smooth light transitions: no popping or harsh cutoffs
- Configurable quality settings (low/medium/high light count)

**Effort**: Medium (9 days)  
**Priority**: Low (visual enhancement)  
**Risk**: High - performance impact may require significant optimization

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/rendering/lighting/system.go:11` (lighting system)
- `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (Issue #3: Future feature)
- Future: `pkg/engine/lighting_system.go` (ECS wrapper)

---

#### 5.4: Weather Particle System

**Description**: Implement procedural weather effects including rain, snow, fog, and wind using particle systems.

**Rationale**: Identified in system integration audit (`docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md`). particles.WeatherSystem is defined but not integrated. Weather effects would add environmental dynamism and genre-appropriate atmosphere.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **System Integration** (1 day):
   - Integrate `pkg/rendering/particles/weather.go` into game
   - Add WeatherComponent to world/area entities
   - Connect to existing ParticleSystem for rendering

2. **Weather Types** (3 days):
   - Rain: 1000+ particles, downward velocity, transparency
   - Snow: 500+ particles, slow downward drift, wind sway
   - Fog: Large particles with high alpha, slow movement
   - Sandstorm: Brown particles, horizontal movement, screen obscuration

3. **Environmental Effects** (2 days):
   - Wind: affects particle movement and player sprite tilt
   - Puddles: accumulate during rain (visual effect only)
   - Visibility: fog reduces draw distance (integration with render culling)
   - Audio integration: rain sounds, wind ambiance

4. **Genre-Specific Weather** (2 days):
   - Fantasy: gentle rain, magical sparkle snow
   - Sci-Fi: acid rain (green tint), radioactive fallout
   - Horror: oppressive fog, blood rain (red particles)
   - Post-apocalyptic: ash fall, toxic storms

**Success Criteria**:
- Weather visible and immersive without obscuring gameplay
- Performance: maintain 60 FPS with 1000 weather particles
- Weather transitions smoothly (fade in/out over 5 seconds)
- Genre-appropriate weather types and intensity
- Optional: weather affects gameplay (movement speed in wind)

**Effort**: Medium (8 days)  
**Priority**: Low (atmospheric enhancement)  
**Risk**: Medium - particle count may impact performance

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/rendering/particles/weather.go:162` (WeatherSystem)
- `pkg/engine/particle_system.go:11` (particle rendering)
- `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (Issue #3: Future feature)

### Category 6: Infrastructure & Tooling (SHOULD HAVE)

**Priority**: Medium-High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small-Medium (1-2 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Should be implemented early to support ongoing development

#### 6.1: Comprehensive System Integration Audit âœ… COMPLETED

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (October 26, 2025)

**Description**: Complete audit and verification of all game systems as specified in `docs/auditors/SCAN_AUDIT.md` to ensure proper wiring and integration.

**Rationale**: As project matured through 8 phases, systems were added incrementally. Need to verify all systems are properly instantiated, registered with ECS world, and communicating correctly. Prevents "orphaned systems" and integration bugs.

**Completion Summary**:
- âœ… **38 total systems** identified and audited across engine, rendering, and audio packages
- âœ… **33 systems verified** as properly integrated (87% integration rate)
- âœ… **5 systems identified** as orphaned/future features (13% - see below)
- âœ… **Zero critical bugs** found - all core gameplay systems functional
- âœ… **Documentation complete**: `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (810 lines) with comprehensive analysis

**Audit Results**:

*Systems Properly Integrated:*
- 22 ECS systems registered in World (Input, Movement, Collision, Combat, AI, etc.)
- 7 Rendering systems (Camera, Render, Terrain, HUD, Tutorial, Help, Menu)
- 5 UI systems (Inventory, Quest, Character, Skills, Map)
- Server correctly uses 6 authoritative ECS systems (no rendering/UI)

*Orphaned/Future Systems Identified:*
1. **RevivalSystem** - Defined but not integrated (addressed in Category 1.1)
2. **EquipmentVisualSystem** - Not integrated (NEW: addressed in Category 5.2)
3. **SpatialPartitionSystem** - Used only in perftest (NEW: addressed in Category 4.3)
4. **lighting.System** - Not integrated (NEW: addressed in Category 5.3)
5. **particles.WeatherSystem** - Not integrated (NEW: addressed in Category 5.4)

*Additional Recommendations from Audit:*
- Dynamic music context switching (NEW: addressed in Category 2.4)
- System lifecycle hooks (Init/Shutdown) - future enhancement
- Runtime system introspection methods - future enhancement

**Next Steps**:
All future features identified in the audit have been added to this roadmap with appropriate prioritization and technical approaches. See Categories 2.4, 4.3, 5.2-5.4 for implementation plans.

**Reference Files**:
- âœ… `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` (completed audit report)
- `cmd/client/main.go:L280-L450` (system initialization verified)
- `pkg/engine/ecs.go:L50-L150` (system registration verified)
- All `pkg/engine/*_system.go` files (audited)

---

#### 6.2: Continuous Logging Enhancement

**Description**: Complete structured logging implementation as specified in `docs/auditors/LOGGING_REQUIREMENTS.md`, ensuring all packages use logrus consistently.

**Rationale**: Logging partially implemented per commit history (commits 2059477, 089c972, 2de8c76). Need to ensure completeness, consistent field usage, and production-ready configuration for debugging and monitoring.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Audit Current State**:
   - Check all packages for logger initialization
   - Verify log levels used appropriately (Debug for internal state, Info for lifecycle, Error for failures)
   - Ensure structured fields (logrus.Fields) used, not string concatenation

2. **Complete Missing Packages**:
   - Add logging to packages with 0 log statements
   - Focus on critical paths: rendering pipeline, network packet handling, save/load operations

3. **Standardize Field Names**:
   - Create `pkg/logging/fields.go` with standard field name constants
   - Entity operations: `entityID`, `componentType`, `systemName`
   - Procgen: `seed`, `genreID`, `depth`, `difficulty`
   - Network: `playerID`, `latency`, `packetSize`

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add conditional debug logging: `if logger.GetLevel() >= logrus.DebugLevel`
   - Lazy evaluation for expensive field computation
   - Ensure no logging in game loop hot paths above Info level

**Success Criteria**:
- All packages in `pkg/` have logger integration
- Consistent field naming across codebase (using constants)
- No performance regression from logging (benchmark validation)
- Client uses text format with color, server uses JSON format
- Environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` controls verbosity without recompilation
- Documentation in `docs/STRUCTURED_LOGGING_GUIDE.md` updated

**Risks**:
- Performance impact from excessive logging (mitigate with conditional compilation and level checks)

**Reference Files**:
- `pkg/logging/logger.go:L1-L100` (logger implementation)
- `docs/STRUCTURED_LOGGING_GUIDE.md` (usage guide)
- All `pkg/` packages for audit
