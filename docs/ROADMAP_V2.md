**Dependencies:** None - builds on Phase 9.4 completion

### 10.1: 360Â° Rotation & Mouse Aim System âœ… **COMPLETE** (October 31, 2025)

**Description:** Transform combat from 4-directional to full 360Â° rotation with independent aim control, enabling dual-stick shooter mechanics (WASD movement + mouse aim).

**Completion Status:**
- âœ… **Week 1-2:** RotationComponent, AimComponent, RotationSystem (100% complete)
- âœ… **Week 3:** Combat system integration with aim-based targeting (100% complete)
- âœ… **Week 4:** Mobile dual joystick controls (100% complete)

**Implemented Components:**
- âœ… `RotationComponent` (`pkg/engine/rotation_component.go`) - 171 lines, 100% tested
  - Full 360Â° rotation using radians
  - Smooth rotation interpolation at 3 rad/s (configurable)
  - Instant rotation mode for teleports
  - Cardinal direction mapping (8 directions)
  - Direction vector calculation
- âœ… `AimComponent` (`pkg/engine/aim_component.go`) - 179 lines, 100% tested
  - Target-based aiming (mouse cursor, touch position)
  - Direct angle specification (gamepad)
  - Auto-aim assist support
  - Attack origin calculation
- âœ… `RotationSystem` (`pkg/engine/rotation_system.go`) - 136 lines, 100% tested

  - `FindEnemyInAimDirection()` function (77 lines)
  - 45Â° aim cone targeting
  - Closest-in-cone selection
  - 100% test coverage (18 tests)

**Test Coverage:** 100% on all new code (57 tests total)

**Rationale:** Current 4-directional system limits combat dynamics. 360Â° rotation with mouse aim enables:
- More precise combat targeting
- Dual-stick shooter gameplay feel
- Projectile-based combat expansion
- Enhanced player agency and skill expression
- Mobile support via virtual joystick (movement) + touch aim

**Technical Approach:**

1. **Component Architecture** (3 days):
   - Add `RotationComponent` to `pkg/engine/rotation_component.go`
     - Fields: `Angle float64` (radians, 0 = right, Ï€/2 = down, Ï€ = left, 3Ï€/2 = up)
     - Fields: `AngularVelocity float64` (for smooth rotation)
     - Fields: `RotationSpeed float64` (max rotation rate, rad/s)
   - Add `AimComponent` to `pkg/engine/aim_component.go`
     - Fields: `AimAngle float64` (independent from facing direction)
     - Fields: `AimTarget Vector2D` (world coordinates for mouse/touch)
     - Fields: `AutoAim bool` (optional aim assist for mobile)

2. **Input System Enhancement** (4 days):
   - Extend `InputSystem` in `pkg/engine/input_system.go`
   - Mouse input: track cursor position, convert to world coordinates
   - Touch input: dual virtual joystick support (left=move, right=aim)
   - Gamepad: left stick=move, right stick=aim (future support)
   - Calculate aim angle: `atan2(targetY - entityY, targetX - entityX)`
   - Smooth rotation: interpolate current angle to target angle using angular velocity

3. **Movement System Integration** (3 days):
   - Update `MovementSystem` in `pkg/engine/movement_system.go`
   - Decouple movement direction from facing direction
   - WASD: set velocity in world-space directions (W=up, A=left, S=down, D=right)
   - Rotation: independently update `RotationComponent.Angle` based on `AimComponent.AimAngle`
   - Smooth rotation: use `RotationComponent.AngularVelocity` to interpolate (3 rad/s default)

4. **Sprite Rendering Update** (5 days):
   - Modify `RenderSystem` in `pkg/engine/render_system.go`
   - Support sprite rotation: use `ebiten.DrawImageOptions.GeoM.Rotate(angle)`
   - Generate rotation-agnostic sprites: design sprites for 0Â° (facing right) as canonical
   - Add directional sprite hints: visual indicators for "front" vs "back" (asymmetric details)
   - Rotation cache: cache rotated sprites at 8 cardinal directions (0Â°, 45Â°, 90Â°, ..., 315Â°)
   - Performance: pre-compute rotated sprites on entity creation

5. **Attack System Integration** (3 days):
   - Update `CombatSystem` in `pkg/engine/combat_system.go`
   - Attacks fire in `AimComponent.AimAngle` direction (not `VelocityComponent` direction)
   - Add attack origin offset: position projectiles at weapon position (not entity center)
   - Melee attacks: use aim direction for hitbox placement
   - Visual feedback: rotate weapon sprite to match aim angle

6. **Mobile Touch Controls** (4 days):
   - Add dual virtual joystick to `pkg/mobile/touch_input.go`
   - Left joystick (bottom-left): movement (WASD equivalent)
   - Right joystick (bottom-right): aim direction
   - Joystick rendering: semi-transparent circles with directional indicators
   - Touch detection: separate left/right screen halves for independent control

**Success Criteria:**
- Player entity rotates smoothly to face mouse cursor (60 FPS, no jitter)
- Movement direction independent from facing direction (strafe mechanics work)
- Attacks fire in aimed direction, not movement direction
- Mobile: dual virtual joysticks provide intuitive control
- Multiplayer: rotation synchronized across clients (<50ms visual latency)
- Performance: <5% frame time increase from rotation calculations
- Deterministic: rotation state serializes/deserializes correctly
- No regressions: existing movement tests pass with rotation disabled

**Implementation Phases:**
- Week 1: Component architecture + input system (7 days)
- Week 2: Movement system integration + sprite rendering (8 days)
- Week 3: Attack system + mobile controls (7 days)
- Week 4: Testing, optimization, multiplayer sync (5 days)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks (27 days)  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Core gameplay change, extensive testing required  
**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests: rotation angle calculations, input conversions
- Integration tests: movement + rotation + combat interaction
- Multiplayer tests: rotation synchronization, prediction accuracy
- Performance tests: frame time with 500 rotating entities
- Mobile tests: touch joystick responsiveness on iOS/Android

     - Projectile speed: 200 (slow arrow) to 1000 (fast bullet) pixels/second
     - Pierce: 0 (normal), 1-3 (rare piercing), -1 (legendary pierce-all)
     - Bounce: 0 (normal), 1-2 (rubber bullets, magic ricochet)
     - Explosive: 10% chance on rare+, radius 50-150 pixels
   - Procedural projectile visuals: shape, color, particle trail based on weapon

4. **Combat System Integration** (3 days):
   - Update `CombatSystem` in `pkg/engine/combat_system.go`

   - Cooldown system: enforce fire rate (already exists, verify compatibility)

5. **Visual Effects** (4 days):
   - Projectile sprites: generate in `pkg/rendering/sprites/projectile.go`
     - Procedural shapes: arrows (thin triangle), bullets (small circle), fireballs (sphere)
     - Color coding: physical (gray/brown), fire (red/orange), ice (blue), poison (green)
   - Particle trails: spawn particles behind projectiles (smoke, magic sparkles)
   - Explosion effects: radial particle burst, screen shake, light flash
   - Impact effects: small particle burst on wall/entity hit

6. **Multiplayer Synchronization** (3 days):
   - Add `ProjectileSpawnMessage` to `pkg/network/protocol.go`
     - Fields: `ProjectileID`, `OwnerID`, `Position`, `Velocity`, `Properties`
   - Client-side prediction: spawn projectiles immediately on local player
   - Server authority: server validates and broadcasts projectile spawns

     - Apply shake offset using sine wave: `offset = intensity * sin(elapsed * frequency * 2Ï€) * (1 - elapsed/duration)`

2. **Hit-Stop System** (2 days):
   - Create `HitStopComponent` in `pkg/engine/time_component.go`
   - Modify game loop: skip `Update()` calls during hit-stop, only render
   - Trigger on: critical hits, boss hits, player death

3. **Visual Impact Effects** (4 days):
   - Color flash: red (player damage), white (critical hit)
   - Particle burst: radial explosion on hit
   - Damage numbers: floating text (optional, configurable)

4. **Procedural Scaling** (2 days):
   - Scale shake based on damage: `intensity = clamp(damage / maxHP * 10, 1, 15)`
   - Player settings: disable/reduce shake (accessibility)

5. **Multiplayer** (2 days):
   - Screen shake client-local (not synchronized)
   - Server broadcasts events triggering visual effects

**Success Criteria:**
- Screen shake visible and satisfying, not nauseating
- Hit-stop creates impact without disrupting gameplay
- Visual effects clearly communicate damage
- Accessibility settings functional
- Performance: <1% frame time increase
- No multiplayer desync

**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (13 days)  
**Risk Level:** LOW - Isolated visual effects

**Reference Files:**
- New: `pkg/engine/camera_component.go`, `pkg/engine/camera_system.go`, `pkg/engine/time_component.go`
- Modify: `pkg/engine/combat_system.go`, `pkg/engine/projectile_system.go`, `cmd/client/main.go`
