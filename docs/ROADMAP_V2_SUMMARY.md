# ROADMAP V2.0 - Executive Summary

## Quick Overview

**Document:** `docs/ROADMAP_V2.md` (1,406 lines, comprehensive planning document)  
**Version:** 2.0 - Enhanced Mechanics  
**Timeline:** 12-14 months (January 2026 - February 2027)  
**Total Effort:** 322 development days across 5 major phases  
**Status:** Phase 10.1 COMPLETE (October 31, 2025) - Ready for Phase 10.2

## What is Version 2.0?

Version 2.0 transforms Venture from a traditional top-down action-RPG into a **next-generation procedural immersive sim** inspired by:
- **Dual-stick shooters** (360° rotation, mouse aim, projectile physics)
- **Immersive sims** (environmental interaction, multiple solutions, emergent gameplay)
- **Modern action-RPGs** (behavior tree AI, faction systems, dynamic narratives)

**All while maintaining:** 100% procedural generation, zero external assets, deterministic seed-based generation, cross-platform support.

  - Genre-specific lighting moods
  - Dynamic lights (flickering, pulsing)
  
- **Animated Sprites**: Frame-by-frame animation
  - Walking, attacking, idle, death animations
  - 4-6 frames per animation
  - Procedurally generated keyframes
  
- **Particle Expansion**: More varieties and behaviors
  - Fire embers, magic sparkles, smoke, blood, debris

## Priority Classification

**CRITICAL (Must Have):**
- 360° rotation & mouse aim
- Projectile physics
- Diagonal walls & multi-layer terrain

**HIGH (Should Have):**
- Screen shake & impact feedback
- Procedural puzzles
- Grammar-based layouts
- Behavior tree AI

**MEDIUM (Could Have):**
- Enhanced environmental destruction

- Squad tactics
- Faction systems
- All polish features

## Performance Targets

**Frame Rate:** 60 FPS minimum, 90 FPS target (with 1000 entities + 100 projectiles + 500 particles)  
**Memory:** <750 MB client, <1.5 GB server (4 players)  
**Network:** <150 KB/s per player, 200-5000ms latency tolerance  
**Generation:** <3s dungeon generation, <500ms narrative generation

## Backward Compatibility

- **Save Migration:** V2.0 can load v1.1 saves
- **Configuration Options:** Toggle rotation, puzzles, AI complexity
- **Legacy Mode:** `-legacy` flag enables v1.1 gameplay mode

## Success Criteria

**Technical:**
- Zero critical bugs
- ≥70% test coverage (≥80% critical packages)
- All performance targets met
- Cross-platform (desktop, web, mobile)

**Gameplay:**
- 360° controls smooth and intuitive
- Projectile combat satisfying and balanced
- Dungeons varied with puzzles
- AI intelligent and challenging
- Dynamic narratives engaging

**User Satisfaction:**
- ≥60 minute average session length
- ≥90% positive on responsiveness/polish
- ≥85% positive on dungeon variety
- ≥70% positive on narrative engagement

## Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Areas:**
1. Projectile physics multiplayer sync → Server-authoritative collision
2. Procedural puzzle generation → Constraint solver validation
3. Dynamic narrative assembly → Strong template library
4. Behavior tree AI overhaul → Profiling and complexity limits

**Strategies:**
- Incremental rollout with testing at each phase
- Feature flags for toggling systems
- Performance budgets enforced per phase
- Determinism validation in automated tests

## What's Deferred to Version 2.1+

- Mod support and custom content loading
- Replay system with seeking
- Achievement system (Steam integration)
- Console ports (Switch, PlayStation, Xbox)
- VR mode (experimental)
- Additional genres (western, noir, steampunk)

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 10.2:** Projectile physics system (Q1 2026)
2. **User Review:** Review updated roadmap progress
3. **Continue Development:** Phase 10.2-10.3 for Version 2.0 Alpha
4. **Iterative Testing:** Alpha/Beta testing at each milestone
