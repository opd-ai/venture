# System Integration Audit & Verification

## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all Ebiten-based game systems to verify proper integration, wiring, and functionality within the Venture game architecture.

## Scope
Audit all system structs that implement Ebiten interfaces or extend the ECS architecture, focusing on:
- Core game systems (rendering, input, audio)
- ECS systems (AI, combat, movement, collision, inventory, progression)
- Network systems (client-server, prediction, lag compensation)
- UI systems (HUD, menus, particle effects)

## Methodology

### Phase 1: System Discovery
1. Identify all system structs across the codebase using grep/semantic search
2. Categorize systems by type (ECS, rendering, input, audio, network, UI)
3. Document expected system interfaces and contracts
4. Create initial inventory in `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md`

### Phase 2: Integration Verification
For each system, verify:
1. **Instantiation**: Where and how the system is created (main.go, game initialization)
2. **Registration**: How it's added to the game engine or ECS world
3. **Lifecycle**: Update/Draw/Init method calls in game loop
4. **Dependencies**: Required components, services, or other systems
5. **State Management**: How it maintains and updates state

### Phase 3: Component Interaction Analysis
Examine how each system:
1. Queries entities and components (ECS patterns)
2. Communicates with other systems (events, direct calls, shared state)
3. Handles edge cases (nil checks, empty collections, initialization order)
4. Manages resources (cleanup, pooling, lifecycle)

### Phase 4: Issue Resolution
When issues are identified:
1. **Fix Immediately**: Don't defer bug fixes‚Äîresolve autonomously during audit
2. **Document Changes**: Record what was broken, why, and how it was fixed
3. **Verify Fix**: Test that the correction doesn't break other systems
4. **Mark Complete**: Only after successful integration verification

## Output Requirements

Create/replace `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` with:
- **System Inventory**: Complete list of all systems with status
- **Integration Status**: ‚úÖ Verified, üîß Fixed, ‚ùå Broken, ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
- **Issues Found**: Detailed description of problems discovered
- **Fixes Applied**: Specific changes made with file paths and line numbers
- **Interaction Map**: How systems connect and depend on each other
- **Recommendations**: Improvements for system architecture or integration patterns

## Success Criteria
- All systems accounted for and categorized
- Integration points verified or corrected
- No orphaned or improperly wired systems
- Documentation complete and accurate
- All identified bugs fixed during audit
- System interaction patterns clearly documented

**Note**: If `docs/FINAL_AUDIT.md` exists, delete and recreate‚Äîdo not append.
