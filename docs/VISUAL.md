Create a PLAN.md document showing a step-by-step plan to improve the representative qualities of the procedurally-generated visual content. We want things to look slightly more like what they are, with approximate to-down views of the arms, body, head of the characters. Perfect representation is probably impossible using only procedural-content-generation, so focus on getting close and meeting the existing space constraints, with the player character being exactly 28x28 pixels at all times.
