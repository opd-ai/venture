package patterns

// Package patterns provides procedural pattern generation for textures and overlays.
//
// This package implements various pattern types (stripes, dots, gradients, noise, checkerboard, circles)
// that can be applied to existing images to add visual variety.
//
// All patterns are generated deterministically using seed-based RNG,
// ensuring reproducible results across game sessions.
